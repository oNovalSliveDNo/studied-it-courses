4	I question anyone saying they dont care for this movie. Some reviewers have said it didnt have enough action, some said it was too long, etc. Dont listen to them!!! If you like Shawshank Redemption and/or Braveheart, you will definitely love this movie!The acting performances are superb! Tim Roth, John Hurt and Jessica Lang are allsuperb and Liam Neeson does an admarible job and is a very imposing character because of his size. The Cinemaphotography was brilliant and breathtaking. It is onw of the few movies I have seen in my life (along with Shawshank) that was virtually flawless from casting, directing, writing, acting, etc.!!!I was amazed this wasnt in the top 50 or 100 movies reviewed. I felt so passionately about it that I just registered with IMDB so I could let everyone know the real scoop. I have seen this movie about 10 times (each time with a different person) and everyone has loved it! You must be awake and pay attention carefully for the first 30 minutes because they introduce quite a few characters in the beginning. If you have the attention span longer than most of these juvenille kids writing reviews for the movies on this site, than you will love this movie! Come on...all 3 Lord of the Rings movies in the top 9 and the Matrix at #32?!?! That should show you the age range of most reviewers here!This is a top 50 movie!!!	movie

6	These are excerpts from a nine-page Memo to Mr. Cohn from Mr. Welles, written after Orson had seen studio mogul Harry Cohns edited version of the picture (he took an hour out): ...The preview title music was written by a first rate composer, George Antheil. Although not written for our picture at all, this temporary title music had an atmosphere of darkness and menace combined with something lush and romantic which made it acceptable...The only musical idea which seems to have occurred to this present composer (Heinz Roemheld) is the rather weary one of using a popular song--the theme--in as many arrangements as possible. Throughout we have musical references to Please Dont Kiss Me for almost every bridge and also for a great deal of the background material. The tune is pleasing, it may do very well on the Hit Parade--but Lady from Shanghai is not a musical comedy...Mr. Roemheld is an ardent devotee of an old-fashioned type of scoring now referred to in our business as Disney. In other words, if somebody falls down, he makes a falling down sound in the orchestra, etc., etc...If the lab had scratched initials and phone numbers all over the negative, I couldnt be unhappier about the results...Just before I left to go abroad, I asked Vi (Viola Lawrence, the editor) to make a cut which would involve dropping the near accident with the taxi-cab and also quite a bit of dialogue. I am convinced that this would have been an excellent cut...saving much needed footage in the slow opening sequence (this was not done, accounting for the main weaknesses of the films opening reel)...There is nothing in the fact of Ritas diving to warrant a big orchestral crescendo...What does matter is Ritas beauty...the evil overtones suggested by Grigsbys character, and Michaels bewilderment. Any or all of these items might have inspired the music. Instead, the dive is treated as though it were a major climax or some antic moment in a Silly Symphony: a pratfall by Pluto the Pup, or a wild jump into space by Donald Duck...There is no sound atmosphere on the boat. A little wind and water is sorely missed. Theres no point in photographing a scene on a real boat if you make it sound as though it all happened in front of a process screen...At the start of the picnic sequence...in the temporary score, we used a very curious, sexy Latin-American strain...This has been replaced with a corny dramatic sequel--bad stock stuff...This sort of music destroys that quality of strangeness which is exactly what might have saved Lady from Shanghai from being just another whodunit...There is a big musical outburst after Grigsbys line, I want you to kill him. This is absurd...The Hawaiian guitar music which comes out of the radio...was supposed to be corny enough to make a certain satirical point. As it stands now, its on about the same level as the rest of the scoring. Nobody in the audience could possibly suspect that were kidding...The aquarium scene needs more echo. Please Dont Kiss Me is in again!...A bad dubbing job and poor scoring has destroyed the character of Michaels run down the pier. From the gunshot through to the phone call, a careful pattern of voices had been built up with the expenditure of much time and effort. For some reason, this has all been junked in favor of a vague hullabaloo. As a result, the whole sequence seems dull...The audience should feel at this point, along with Michael, that maybe they are going crazy. The new dubbing job can only make them feel that maybe theyre going to sleep...The gun battle with the breaking mirrors must not be backed with music...The closing music again makes reference to Please Dont Kiss Me...This finale is obvious to the point of vulgarity, and does incalculable injury to the finish of the picture.All of these edits from Orson were ignored	movie

8	Microsoft gets the blogging bug\n\nSoftware giant Microsoft is taking the plunge into the world of blogging.\n\nIt is launching a test service to allow people to publish blogs, or online journals, called MSN Spaces. Microsoft is trailing behind competitors like Google and AOL, which already offer services which make it easy for people to set up web journals. Blogs, short for web logs, have become a popular way for people to talk about their lives and express opinions online.\n\nMSN Spaces is free to anyone with a Hotmail or MSN Messenger account. People will be able to choose a layout for the page, upload images and share photo albums and music playlists. The service will be supported by banner ads. This is a simple tool for people to express themselves, said MSNs Blake Irving. This is Microsofts first foray into blogging, which has taken off as a web phenomenon in the past year. Competitors like Google already offer free services through its Blogger site, while AOL provides its members with journals. Accurate figures for the number of blogs in existence are hard to come by. According to blog analysis firm Technorati, the so-called blogosphere, has doubled every five and a half months for the last 18 months. It now estimates that the number of blogs in existence has exceeded 4.8 million, although some speculate that less than a quarter are regularly maintained.\n	tech
9	Lib Dems to target stamp duty\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are promising to raise the stamp duty threshold if they win the general election, in a bid to court first-time house buyers.\n\nVince Cable, the partys Treasury spokesman, said raising the threshold to £150,000 would prevent over 400,000 home-buyers from paying the tax. He said first-time buyers were being squeezed out of the housing market. The Labour party said the Liberal Democrats needed to explain how they would pay for the plan. The plan forms part of a wider Lib Dems policy to encourage first time buyers and those on lower incomes into the market.\n\nUnder the proposals, the average saving for a new buyer would be more than £1,000, according to Mr Cable. First time buyers are being squeezed out of the housing market not only by higher house prices but also by being swept into the stamp duty net, he said. By failing to uprate the stamp duty threshold Gordon Brown has hit first time buyers and those on low incomes the hardest. By pledging to increase the threshold to £150,000, the Liberal Democrats will make it possible for many first time buyers to buy a property without facing this tax. Paul Boateng MP, Labours Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: The Lib Dems sums dont add up. They can have no credibility until they can say how they would fund their ever growing list of tax and spending commitments. Mr Cable will publish his Alternative Budget on Monday.\n	politics
10	UKIP candidate suspended in probe\n\nEurosceptic party UKIP have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed.\n\nJohn Houston, 54, was due to stand in the East Kilbride seat in Lanarkshire at the next election. But he was suspended after his reported views, including the return of the British Empire, were sent to two Scottish newspapers. UKIP spokesman Mark Croucher said those who selected Mr Houston knew nothing of his views. The episode comes at a difficult time for UKIP, soon after the high-profile departure of MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk. Mr Houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be made available to law-abiding members of the community and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. The document reportedly said: Were looking for the resurrection of the British Empire. The problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale, and that calls for a radical alliance of the English-speaking nations, which they are uniquely able to do. Mr Croucher said the main issue would be that Mr Houstons reported views had been presented as UKIP policy, which they were not. He said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the partys manifesto, but would not have been matched to Mr Houston when he was standing to become a candidate. He told BBC News: He appears to have said these things. We have suspended him as a member and as a candidate. By all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting. It is simply a distraction from the task in hand, the EU constitution, not individual idiocies. Mr Houston was quoted in the Herald newspaper saying: I feel UKIP have over-reacted and overshot the runway.\n\nPeter Nielson, who is UKIP Scotland chairman, said he had suspended Mr Houston on Friday night. He will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken. He said that any evidence would be looked into and Mr Houston may be interviewed by the party. He added: I cant comment too much at the moment, I have one version from him but I havent seen the papers yet.\n	politics

12	No matter how well meaning his message is - this film is a terribly made trainwreck - awful acting, lame camera work - I do not know why Carr agreed to try and pull off a stutter - he is lousy at it. You watch the extras on the DVD and the way he has a camera follow him around - he just soaks it up - he loves being the center of attention. He is a bad actor - he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker - Eric Schaffer. Some how Carr has had this film shown at city Youth Centers and New Age churches - where damaged people looking for reinforcement and attention themselves babble on about how the film touched them and maybe it did - but as a film itself it is choppy, predictable and sappy.	movie
13	Visa decision every 11 minutes\n\nVisa processing staff are sometimes expected to rule on an application every 11 minutes, MPs have said.\n\nPressure was placed on staff to be efficient, rather than to do a thorough examination of an application, the Public Accounts Committee found. Every officer had an annual target of 8,000 applications - equivalent to 40 a day or one every 11 minutes. MPs want research into whether UK visa holders leave at the end of their stays, or vanish into the black market. Committee chairman Edward Leigh said: There is a worrying tension between quick processing and proper control over the visas issued. Entry clearance staff are expected to deal with a visa application in about 11 minutes which is surely too little time to look closely at the supporting documents. \n\nThe committees report also discussed the Romanian and Bulgarian visas scandal which led to the resignation of immigration minister Beverley Hughes last year. Committee members said the Home Office had been wrong to dismiss concerns from visa staff abroad who feared the system was being abused. Investigations carried out in the wake of Ms Hughes resignation found more than 7,000 people had entered the UK under the business visa scheme for Romanian and Bulgarian entrepreneurs. Mr Leigh said the Home Office should now consider removing those who had not set up a valid business. A Home Office spokesman said the system had been toughened and tightened since the investigation. He added that the traditional system of a dual decision making process for all pre-entry applications will be replaced by a single pre-entry check at post, which will be simpler and more robust against abuse than the current system.\n	politics
14	I give 3 stars only for the beautiful pictures of Africa. The rest was... well pretty boring. For about 50min we have the outline of the plot... In War of the worlds, the introductory part lasted, oh, about 10min? Then was real action! This is something like:Lets take a walk in the savanna and gasp at the beautiful sunsets!. And maybe deliver a message, like Dont kill elephants!. Very ecological. I would have expected this out of a new Steven Segal movie, not from this... The leading actress makes me think about artificial sun-tan, dyed hair and too much foundation! And I didnt see one scene where her hair is messed up, or she sweats, or her clothes are dusty. She just doesnt look like a 19 century woman! And in the bar, where they seek up our hero, Swayze makes a comment about the commander that he looks like Dracula. Hmmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896, and it became famous in the next years. Livingstone and other explorers went to central Africa from 1840 to 1880. So unless the action takes place between 1896 and 1900.. Houston, we have a problem. :) Swayze makes a nice impression.. as a nutshell - hard on the outside, but soft and cuddly on the inside. Not that I would cuddle with a nut, but you get the point. He really manages to have that beaten puppy look on his face on several occasions. The movie stank. Way too long and increasingly boring. dont watch it! Dont buy it! Its a waste of your money!	movie
15	REM concerts blighted by illness\n\nUS rock band REM have been forced to cancel concerts after bass player Mike Mills was taken to hospital suffering from severe flu-like symptoms.\n\nThe band were forced to cut short Monday nights show in Sheffield, and have cancelled Tuesdays Glasgow date. Mills could hardly stand up, let alone play, said an REM spokesman, who added he is now resting in hospital. The remainder of the band played a short acoustic set on Monday. Tuesdays gig has been rescheduled for 15 June. Those who had a ticket for the show in Glasgow are being advised to retain their ticket stub so they can attend the new date. The bands spokesman said that they would review their remaining dates on a day-to-day basis, based on doctors advice to Mills. Obviously we all want Mike to get better, and clearly we all want to play the shows. Rest assured we will do so as soon as possible, he said.\n\nThe band were still hopeful they would be able to make their Wednesday date, added the spokesman. REM played accoustic versions of their hits Losing My Religion, Ive Been High, Leaving New York and The One I Love to the Sheffield Arena audience on Monday. The band had originally been scheduled to play four dates in the UK as part of a world tour. In 1995 former drummer Bill Berry collapsed in Switzerland while the band was on tour, having suffered a ruptured aneurysm. He made a full recovery, only to leave the band two years later.\n	entertainment

I saw her in an interview with Ellen Degeneres and she behaves exactly the same as she does in movies. Her foolish facial expressions make me want to change channels. She has been in a couple of good movies, but they would have been better had someone else been picked for the part. Steve Martin doesnt add much to the movie either. He over acts as well and also ruins an old favorite. The ridiculous part Martin Short plays only adds more idiocies to the movie.

20	Compared to the recent gore flick HOSTEL, which this movie reminded me a lot of-- I would say that See No Evil is slightly better but not by much. The very complex plot involves a handful of delinquents who are sent to clean up a rundown hotel for a shorter jail sentence. The kids soon end up being killed off by a lumbering religious psychopath who is cleansing them of their sins (I guess). The one thing I dreaded most prior to seeing this was the fact that it stared a WWE wrestler, Kane. He ended up doing a decent job considering he only had 2 one-word lines in the movie. There are a couple fairly gory moments, mainly involving eye-gouging and a quite memorable scene in which a girl gets a cellphone shoved down her throat-- probably the most effective demise in the movie.I cant say that this movie really shows us anything new and is definitely far from great. Cant recommend it.	movie

22	Standard Life cuts policy bonuses\n\nStandard Life, Europes largest mutual life insurer, has cut bonuses for with-profit policyholders.\n\nAnnual bonus rates on its with-profits life policies were cut from 2.5% to 2%, while bonuses on pension policies were reduced from 3.25% to 2.5%. It is the sixth time in three years Standard Life has made cuts to bonus rates, despite an 8.7% rise in the value of the with-profits fund in 2004. The insurer blamed the cuts on poor share returns and low interest rates.\n\nWith-profits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility. Profits made in good years are kept in reserve to pay investors an annual bonus even when the stock market performs badly. Slumping share prices throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies. Standard Life came in for criticism for sticking with stock market investments during 2001 and 2002. The insurer argued that shares outperformed other investments over the long term and that policyholders would feel the benefit when the stock market recovered. Recently, Norwich Union and Axa Sun Life both cut their with-profit bonus rates.\n\nJohn Gill, managing director of the insurers life and pensions division, said that a strong stock market recovery in the past two years had only partly compensated for losses during 2001 and 2002. In addition, low interest rates meant that long-term investment returns are well below historic levels, Mr Gill added. However, Mr Gill maintained that with-profits continued to perform well over the long term. Our payouts continue to stand up well against other types of long-term investments over similar periods, he said. Standard Life has an estimated 2.4 million with-profits policyholders. Last year, the company announced that it was looking to float on the stock market in 2006.\n	business
23	Updating of the Bliss theme is merely the latest in a lengthening queue of bad-to-average local comedies which appeal to the conservative cinema-going set. (For the record, this list, all of the films on which appear to be attempting a Castle-esque miracle, includes, Strange Bedfellows, Thunderstruck, Bad Eggs, The Honourable Wally Norman, Horseplay, The Wannabes and The Nugget. The only one to have worked has been Crackerjack.)Here, the performances never mesh, as John Howard doesnt even look like hes in the right film  though perhaps that was the intention, as Franklin plays sleepy, conservative suburbia against its more interesting inhabitants. 20-year-old virgins who live with their parents are becoming rarer on-screen, but this is hardly a reason to watch the film. In fact, the only reasons may well be (1) Howards bizarre  but quite fun  performance, and (2) the suburban nightmare theme, which has run through Somersault, Strange Bedfellows, Tom White, Alexandras Project, Danny Deckchair, The Rage in Placid Lake, Traveling Light, Teesh & Trude, Swimming Upstream and Lantana, many of which are very good/excellent. Enter at own risk! May be one for people who titter at the word penis. 4/10.	movie

25	Format wars could confuse users\n\nTechnology firms Sony, Philips, Matsushita and Samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video.\n\nThe firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. The move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different, and conflicting, content control systems, experts warned. They say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy.\n\nCurrently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. Systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as Digital Rights Management systems. By setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. In a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content. The firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought. Called the Marlin Joint Development Association, the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. Marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm Intertrust as well as an earlier DRM system developed by a group known as the Coral Consortium.\n\nThe move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by Apple and Microsoft. Confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as Microsoft and Apple. In many ways the different DRM systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as Betamax and VHS, that consumers have seen in the past, said Ian Fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at Jupiter Research. The difference is that it is very fragmented, he said. Its not a two-horse race, its a five, six, seven or even eight-horse race Mr Fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. He said currently there were even incompatibilities within DRM families. Although initiatives such as Microsofts Plays for Sure program could help remove some of the uncertainty, he said, life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come.\n\nShelley Taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. Apples iTunes service was a perfect example of this, she said. Although iTunes has been hugely successful, Apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those iPods, she said.\n\nShe said rampant competition between online music services, of which there are now 230 according to recent figures, could drive more openness and freer file formats. It always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run, she said, and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest. Ms Taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop. People want portability, she said, and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability. Cory Doctorow, European co-ordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues, expressed doubts that the Marlin system would achieve its aims. Not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying, he said. He said many firms readily admit that their DRM systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. Instead, said Mr Doctorow, DRM systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers. The studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the iPod version, the auto version, the American and UK version, the ringtone version, and so on.\n	tech
26	A lack of character development proves fatal for this movie. Valeria Golinos character Grazia starts out looking like a bipolar personality but quickly degenerates into a caricature and seems unreal. The other characters are thin, probably the writers fault not the actors. The only exception is Filippo Pucillo as the younger son Filippo: his energy and bravado are funny and convincing.I suppose the childrens petty cruelty is supposed to contribute to an atmosphere of bleakness and emphasize the pervasive primal spirits in the town, but for me, the gratuitous cruelty is redundant and contributes to the overall boredom of the film. Some scenes were amusing but not necessarily intended that way, for example, when the mistreated dogs turn out to be fat and healthy and look like they are ready to show. The pretty cast and setting make for an appealing trailer but cannot carry the whole movie.	movie

29	I remember watching Lost Missile (actually throwing a fit until my brother and several cousins at whose home I was an overnight guest agreed to watch it with me - I was, from time to time, the Eric Cartman of the 1960s - sorry, guys) and being somewhat embarrassed when the sustained wave of million-degree heat emerged as a plot device - even as a second-grader I knew that a mere missile just couldnt carry the energy around for that much heat or devastation over more than the duration and limited radius of a nuclear detonation. My inflicting that turkey on loving relatives was a self-punishing crime.The films production values were very good. The acting isnt bad (apart from the Shatnerism of the actor who played governors aide that someone else here mentioned).But the idea of a missile Easy-Baking the surface of the Earth by means of the heat of its exhaust... no.Howd the people at Mystery Science Theater 3000 miss The Lost Missile, anyway? Its a great classic of unintentional comedy - watch it if you want something to drink beer to some weekend.	movie
30	I rented this movie from my local library and thought it might be good considering I like this type of movie and considering who was in it but boy was I wrong. The acting stunk, the fight scenes were just as bad and they got a couple of known people to be in it but didnt cast anyone with acting ability to play the lead? I noticed some people gave it a 10. Why would you ever consider giving this pile of horse **** a 10. You can say its worth a 10 for the sheer comedy of it but when you vote on a movie thats not supposed to be a comedy you cant give it a 10 for comedy. You have to rate it on what it was supposed to actually be like and not for something the director wasnt intending. Maybe some of you voted 10 cause you thought it would be funny to have this crappy movie have a high rating so that people would go out and rent or buy it cause you think its fun to mislead people. Youre playing with peoples time and money which you have no right to do. If the movie sucked give it a bad rating if it was good give it a good rating but dont lie. I gave this movie a 4 and am glad that I was able to check this out for free from my library cause this movie sucked and really isnt worth paying a cent to see.	movie

33	As long as you go into this movie with the understanding that its not going to contain any historical fact whatsoever, its not bad.Its on par with Sam Raimis Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, as far as plot, acting, humour, and production values are concerned. Youll see the similarities at several points. Most of the fight scenes are not as good however and the film suffers from that.Jack Palance commands the screen as well as ever, and at no time do you have the impression hes giving anything less than his level best. Same for Oliver Reed. The problem is that their strong performances make square-jawed Don Diamonts less-than-stellar acting skills seem even more awkward. Perennial bit player Cas Anvar was very good as well, playing a character much like Salmonius in the aforementioned Hercules.If you enjoyed the low budget swords-and-sorcery movies of the early 80s, youre probably going to enjoy this show as well. Its actually a shame they attached the Marco Polo name to it. It really has nothing to do with Marcos life, contrary to the expectations of most of the people who will want to watch this movie.	movie
34	Why every horror director wants to imitate The Exorcist is a complete riddle to me, as William Friedkins classic is a very overrated film and, in my opinion, not all that tense or shocking. And yet heres another clean rip-off, a Spanish one this time, that shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl that gets possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family. Paul Naschy (who I must admit looks quite hot here) plays the honorable priest who gets approached by John Gibson because his sister Leilas behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend. At first the priest doesnt believe it but when Johns body is discovered with its neck twisted, Leilas demonic behavior becomes more noticeable... Exorcism is not only very unoriginal, its also an insufferably boring film! Here Naschy and director Juan Bosch had an open opportunity to make a religiously themed exploitation flick full of shocks and gore, and yet the result is a tame and overall bloodless drama thatll nearly put you to sleep! The last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments, albeit very stupid, and theres quite a lot of stylishly filmed female nudity and sleaze. The absolute lack of budget is no real excuse since Paul Naschy already proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for a shortage in money. This is just an awful film, end of story. Other European The Excorcist rip-offs are The Antichrist and Beyond the Door and they suck as well!	movie

I served in the Army and can understand the intensity of the training at Parris Island (Camp Death by some)so this movie can never come close as does Full Metal Jacket. I think this is a good movie which is more patriot than it is actual. But again, think of the time period it was made (1957) and what could be allowed and said on film at that time. I have always found Jack Webb to be clean cut and very loyal. I know many have criticized the film as one-sided and government propaganda. If you feel this way, watch Full Metal Jacket with R Lee Ermey. I am a Webb fan and enjoy the movie for its merit, not accuracy. As I have said, Webb believed in this country and held institutions to high moral standards (LAPD-Dragnet,Adam 12, Emergency etc). Just sit back and enjoy this one from a very strict moral time period in this country. Dont be too judgemental of Mr. Webb. Mark Lockwood Lubbock Texas..	movie
36	Dollar gains on Greenspan speech\n\nThe dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the Federal Reserve head said the US trade deficit is set to stabilise.\n\nAnd Alan Greenspan highlighted the US governments willingness to curb spending and rising household savings as factors which may help to reduce it. In late trading in New York, the dollar reached $1.2871 against the euro, from $1.2974 on Thursday. Market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months. On Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Mr Greenspans speech in London ahead of the meeting of G7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse-than-expected US jobs data. I think the chairmans taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than hes taken for some time, said Robert Sinche, head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York. Hes taking a longer-term view, laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next.\n\nWorries about the deficit concerns about China do, however, remain. Chinas currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currencys sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive. But calls for a shift in Beijings policy have fallen on deaf ears, despite recent comments in a major Chinese newspaper that the time is ripe for a loosening of the peg. The G7 meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in Chinese policy. In the meantime, the US Federal Reserves decision on 2 February to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point - the sixth such move in as many months - has opened up a differential with European rates. The half-point window, some believe, could be enough to keep US assets looking more attractive, and could help prop up the dollar. The recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits, as well as the USs yawning current account gap, both of which need to be funded by the buying of US bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments. The White House will announce its budget on Monday, and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars.\n	business

38	Having just seen this on TMC, its fresh in my mind. Its obvious that while the stooges are featured stars, they dont really run the show. First, theyre broken into 2 groups - Moe, as Shorty and Larry and Curly as a pair of vagrants, so theres not a whole lot of full team work. The love story that fuels the plot is uninteresting, the two ladies are the only ones with any acting ability, theres another group of musical stooges that are unfunny, unless you consider their attempts at being funny to be sadly buffoonish. The music is tiresome, they drive cars to the ranch and then depend on horses, the dorky western wear is silly, and theres an awful lot of the movie with no stooges on camera. By the way, this is obviously after Curleys first stroke, and his reduced energy level is clear. Vernon Dent appears early on in an uncredited role. I loved everything these guys ever did, including all the non-Curley stuff, but this little dogie is pretty lousy.	movie

71	Off-colour Gardener storms to win\n\nBritains Jason Gardener shook off an upset stomach to win the 60m at Sundays Leipzig International meeting.\n\nGardener clocked 6.56 seconds to equal the meeting record and finished well ahead of Germanys Marc Blume, who crossed the line in 6.67 secs. The world indoor champion said: I got to the airport and my stomach was upset and I was vomiting. I almost went home. I felt a little better Sunday morning but decided Id only run in the main race. Then everything went perfectly. Gardener, part of the Great Britain 4x100m quartet that won gold at the Athens Olympics, will now turn his attention to next weekends Norwich Union European Indoor trials in Sheffield.\n\nGiven I am still off-colour I know there is plenty more in the tank and I expect to get faster in the next few weeks, he said. Its just a case of chipping away as I have done in previous years and the results will come. Scotlands Ian Mackie was also in action in Leipzig. He stepped down from his favoured 400m to 200m to finish third in 21.72 secs. Germanys Alexander Kosenkow won the race in 21.07 secs with Dutchman Patrick van Balkom second in 21.58 secs. There were plenty of other senior British athletes showing their indoor form over the weekend. Promising 60m hurdler\n\nclocked a new UK record of 7.98 seconds at a meeting in Norway. The 24-year-old reached the mark in her heat but had to settle for joint first place with former AAA champion Diane Allahgreen in the final.\n\n, who broke onto the international scene at the Olympic Games last season, set an indoor personal best of 16.50m in the triple jump at a meeting in Ghent. That leap - 37cm short of Brazilian winner Jadel Gregorios effort - was good enough to qualify for the European Indoor Championships. At the same meeting,\n\nfinished third in 7.27 seconds in a high-class womens 60m. The event was won by European medal favourite Christine Arron of France while Belgium rival Kim Gevaert was second. Britains Joice Maduaka finished fifth in 7.35. Olympic bronze heptathlon medallist\n\nmade a low-key return to action at an indoor meeting in Birmingham. The 28-year-old cleared 1.76m to win the high jump and threw 13.86m in the womens shot put.\n	sport

39	Blair ready to call election\n\nTony Blair seems certain to end weeks of phoney war on Monday and announce there will be a general election on 5 May.\n\nThe date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and, despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll, it has not shifted. Over the weeks, there have been any number of signs that 050505 was going to be the day Mr Blair would go for an historic third term. And the calling of a special political cabinet meeting has only added to the belief that the announcement is imminent. The prime minister and his campaign boss Alan Milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between Labours stability and investment against Tory cuts and boom and bust.\n\nAnd Chancellor Gordon Brown has stepped into the front line of the campaign - to the relief of many of his supporters in Westminster - to underline that economic message. And it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties tax and spend policies.\n\nDuring the phoney campaign, Labour got into trouble over its central claim that Michael Howard was planning £35 bn cuts in public services. The prime minister found himself struggling to explain how a smaller, slower increase in spending planned by the Tories compared to Labours plans was a cut. And it looked like the Labour campaign - which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by Mr Howard on issues such as immigration and health - was on the rocks. Then deputy Conservative Chairman Howard Flight was reported to have suggested Mr Howard was secretly planning even bigger cuts.\n\nHe was sacked for his gaffe, but the damage had been done and the faltering Labour campaign was back on track. A second central argument will be over taxation, with the Tories claiming the Chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if Labour wins again. Mr Brown slaps that aside, claiming his forecasts are accurate and that previous claims of looming economic disaster have proved inaccurate. As usual, the Liberal Democrats will have to fight to get their voice heard over the sounds of battle between the two big parties. But leader Charles Kennedy believes he has set out a distinctive manifesto with plans for a tax rise for the wealthiest to finance extra spending and the abolition of the council tax in favour of a local income tax. Other issues are certain to play a part - immigration and asylum, the war on Iraq, law and order and education, for example. But, as ever, it will be the economy that will almost certainly decide the outcome. And, whatever that outcome, 2005 is set to be a far more lively, even bitter campaign than 2001s non-event.\n	politics
40	Row over police power for CSOs\n\nThe Police Federation has said it strongly opposes giving Community Support Officers (CSOs) the power to detain suspects for up to 30 minutes.\n\nThe powers - piloted in six areas - were extended to all police forces in England and Wales on Thursday. The federation said CSOs do not have the experience, training and safety equipment to deal with potentially confrontational situations. But the government said the move would help police build safe communities. Police Federation chairman Jan Berry said civilian officers should act as eyes and ears for the police.\n\nThey should not be placed in potentially confrontational situations - which detaining someone clearly is, she said. CSOs can now use reasonable force to detain suspects for up to 30 minutes while they wait for police officers to arrive. The powers will be granted by chief constables of local forces. Ms Berry said this dramatically changes their original purpose - to be a visible presence combating low-level crime and anti-social behaviour. She said more powers would mean more paperwork and less time on the street.\n\nBut Home Office minister Hazel Blears defended the move saying it would give the civilian officers just that little bit of edge. She denied their role was changing and said the new powers would not take them away from the streets.\n\nThe powers that we are bringing in are things that they need to do when they are out patrolling, she said. The Home Office has produced its own report on CSOs which it describes as encouraging. Ms Blears said the study shows CSOs are making a real difference in the fight against crime. But the report also showed that the public is having difficulties distinguishing between a civilian officer and a proper officer.\n\nShadow home secretary David Davis said the research appeared to acknowledge that CSOs were having no discernible effect on crime figures.\n\nWhile the answer is a lot more real police, the government wants to recruit 25,000 people who cant arrest anyone, he said. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the research is inconclusive. There are about 3,500 CSOs in England and Wales but the government intends to have 25,000 on the streets by 2008 at a cost of £50m. They already have powers to hand out fines for a wide range of offences. The Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill proposes extra powers to search suspects, enforce licensing offences, direct traffic and deter begging.\n	politics

45	Robotic pods take on car design\n\nA new breed of wearable robotic vehicles that envelop drivers are being developed by Japanese car giant Toyota.\n\nThe companys vision for the single passenger in the 21st Century involves the driver cruising by in a four-wheeled leaf-like device or strolling along encased in an egg-shaped cocoon that walks upright on two feet. Both these prototypes will be demonstrated, along with other concept vehicles and helper robots, at the Toyota stand at the Expo 2005 in Aichi, Japan, in March 2005. The models are being positioned as so-called personal mobility devices, which have few limits. The open leaf-like i-unit vehicle is the latest version of the concept which the company introduced last year. Built using environmentally friendly plant-based materials, the single passenger unit is equipped with intelligent transport system technologies that allow for safe autopilot driving in specially equipped lanes. The model allows the user to make tight on-the-spot turns, move upright amongst other people at low speeds and can be easily switched into a reclining position at higher speeds. Body colours can be customized to suit individual preferences and a personal recognition system offers both information and music.\n\nAlso on display at the show will be the egg-shaped i-foot. This is a two-legged mountable robot like device that can be controlled with a joystick.\n\nStanding at a height of well over seven feet (2.1 metres), the unit can walk along at a speed of about 1.35km/h (0.83mph) and navigate staircases into the bargain. Mounting and dismounting is accomplished with the aid of the bird-like legs that bend over backwards. They are clearly what we call concept vehicles, innovative ideas which have yet to be transformed into potential products and which are a few years away from actual production, said Dr David Gillingwater from the Transport Studies Group at Loughborough University. They clearly have eye-catching appeal, which is in part the name of the game here, and are linked to the iMac and iPod-type niche which Apple have been responsible for developing and leading in recent years - new, different, hi-tech, image conscious products. As always with these concept vehicles, it is difficult to see who they would appeal to and what their role would be in the personal transport marketplace.\n\nThe personal transport arena is taking on a new dimension though with futuristic devices that augment human capabilities. Toyotas prototypes represent the latest incarnation of wearable exoskeletons in a vehicular form that is specially focused on transport. Powered robotic exoskeletons have been the focus of much US military research over the years and Japan seems to have jumped onto the bandwagon with a wave of products being developed for specific applications. With an emerging range of devices targeted towards the ageing world population, care giving and the military, wearable exoskeletons seem to represent a new line of future technologies that meet an individuals particular mobility needs. While Toyotas prototypes are geared towards mass transport, the company says that the vehicles will allow the elderly and the disabled to achieve independent mobility.\n\nExperts, though, are a bit sceptical of their acceptance in this area.\n\nThose with arguably the greatest needs for this sort of assistance, now and certainly in the future, are the elderly and infirm people, Dr Gillingwater told the BBC News website. You have to ask whether these sorts of vehicles will appeal to these groups. Design considerations also exist. Dr Erel Avineri, of the Centre for Transport and Society at the University of the West of England in Bristol said: The design of the introduced mobility devices is not completely adjusted to the specific needs of the elderly and the disabled. For example, one problem that many older passengers experience is limited ability to rotate the neck and upper body, making it difficult to look to the side and back when backing up. It looks like the visual design of the device interior does not consider this need. This and other human-factors related issues in the design of such devices are not the only issues that should be considered, said Dr Avineri. In general, introducing a new technology requires the passenger to change behaviour patterns that have served the older passenger for decades. Elderly users might not necessarily accept such innovation. This may be another barrier to the commercial success of such a vehicle. Such single-person vehicles may find a relatively small market niche and may be more suited towards specialised applications rather than revolutionising the face of mass transport. The concept of personal mobility behind these sorts of innovations is great but they beg a huge number of questions, said Dr Gillingwater. Whats their range? How user-friendly will they really be? What infrastructure will be required to allow these vehicles to be used. Overall I think these vehicles pose a number of important questions than provide answers or solutions.\n	tech
46	Business vs. personal conviction. Profit vs. art.As with any documentary that pits the capitalist large corporations against the small producer, the viewer will invariably have to take the side of one or the other based on their own believes. This is as much a documentary of the new standardized way of doing things that globalization is bringing us, against the old traditional ways where character and the art of making things matters almost more than getting the product sold.If you have to remember one thing from this movie, it is that the masses can no longer decide by themselves, they just follow the taste of one or a couple of critics that tend to equalize and standardize taste in the same way as MacDonalds used to do for the fast bite (something Parker himself admits to in the film against a backdrop of a Burger King sign). It is all about image against content as another interviewee says. That is the easy way, the standardized way. Easier than taking the time for a nice wine to mature, easier than to forge your own taste by trying and trying yet over again. Controlled branded taste is easier.There is a glitter of hope when even some of our cousins across the ocean agree that a few people are levelling the taste of wines to maximize the profits and ensure a maximum of it gets sold to the grey masses. Individuality and difference is sacrificed for the extra buck. It is nice to see that not everything or everyone is giving in to standardization, even across the ocean.As in many other areas of todays world, dominance of a few and reduced freedom of choice impacts us all... let everyone make up their mind and decide what to go for. Too much standardization kills the mind and taste; difference brings innovation and healthy competition and will allow for choice - and not just vacuum-packed more of the same. Standardization sells easily and a lot, and brings everyone to the same level - the lower one.On this, I am going to open up a nice bottle and wish you a hearthy sante.	movie

80	A very bad film, an amalgam of clichés and historical inaccuracies. A few examples: in an early scene Soviet infantry are attacked by the Germans; instead of staying in their trenches to shoot at them, they advance into open ground to fight them,contrary to all infantry tactics; Kate, one of the central characters, is supposedly the daughter of a White Russian and obsessed with her Russianness, yet she does not speak Russian; a guilt-stricken German airman attacks an anti-aircraft gun- the gun, however, does not fire shrapnel shells but scores a direct hit on his plane, which doesnt look much like a German plane of WWII. In fairness, when they could escape the preposterous plot and the consequent absurdities there are some genuinely powerful moments- the depiction of people slowly starving to death is convincingly done and moving, but these only show up the rest of it even more. A film to be avoided.	movie
48	Indonesians face fuel price rise\n\nIndonesias government has confirmed it is considering raising fuel prices by as much as 30%.\n\nMillions of Indonesians use kerosene for basic cooking, and prices have been heavily subsidised for years. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyonos government has said it wants to curb fuel subsidies and direct the money into aid programmes for the poor. But critics argue cutting subsidies will hurt the poorer families that his government says it wants to help. Millions of people were left homeless in Indonesia Acehs region following the earthquake and tsunami disaster in late December.\n\nIndonesia pays subsidies to importers in order to stabilise domestic fuel prices, but higher oil prices have forced the government to spend more on holding prices down. It spent 59.2 trillion rupiah ($6.58bn; £3.5bn) on fuel subsidies in 2004, a sum far in excess of its original projection of 14.5 trillion rupiah. Since President Yudhoyonos government came to power in October, it has indicated its intention of raising domestic fuel prices by cutting subsidies. The (January to March) quarter of this year is the best time for us to increase fuel prices, said Sri Mulyani Indrawati, State Minister for National Development Planning. We are still considering if a 30% hike is suitable at the moment. The sooner the better for the state budget. The BBCs correspondent in Jakarta, Rachel Harvey, told World Business Report that there was likely to be a strong public reaction to any price rise. The big question is whether they go for one big, short, sharp shock and raise prices between 20% and 30% or whether they try to stagger it, she said. Indonesias previous government, led by President Megawati Sukarnoputri, also attempted to cut subsidies in 2003, but was forced to back down in the face of public protests.\n	business

50	There is this private campground in Plymouth, Massachusetts, thats been around since 1959. My grandparents were among its founders, my parents had a site starting in 1965, and my two brothers have sites there now.(This doesnt have anything directly to do with the movie; bear with me.) I spent summers at Blueberry Hill from when I was five years old to when I was eighteen, and it is to people like me to whom this film speaks: the ones for whom a group camp in the woods was, as my fiancée tells of me, the good and happy place. If youve never experienced the lifestyle, Indian Summer will probably be lost on you; dont bother. Its not quick-paced, it doesnt have rapid cuts, the plots arent in the least bit convoluted, it has no explosions, such dramatic tension as exists is mild, there arent any A-list actors, there are no rapid-fire quips just to show off how clever the scriptwriters are (other than, perhaps, Kimberley Williams killer line about how her fiancé shouldnt overwind his toys. That is not the least degree what this movie is about, any more than The Godfather is a slasher flick just because it has a lot of on screen gore.But Indian Summer is Godfathers polar opposite. If you have experienced the lifestyle, see this movie. Dont read any more, just do it.For me, this is a 9/10 film.	movie
51	World leaders gather to face uncertainty\n\nMore than 2,000 business and political leaders from around the globe are arriving in the Swiss mountain resort Davos for the annual World Economic Forum (WEF). For five days, they will discuss issues ranging from Chinas economic power to Iraqs future after this Sundays elections. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and South African President Thabo Mbeki are among the more than 20 government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting. Unlike previous years, protests against the WEF are expected to be muted. Anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend.\n\nThe Brazilian city of Porto Alegre will host the rival World Social Forum, timed to run in parallel with the WEFs ritzier event in Davos.\n\nThe organisers of the Brazilian gathering, which brings together thousands of campaigners against globalisation, for fair trade, and many other causes, have promised to set an alternative agenda to that of the Swiss summit. However, many of the issues discussed in Porto Alegre are Davos talking points as well. Global warming features particularly high. WEF participants are being asked to offset the carbon emissions they cause by travelling to the event. Davos itself is in deep frost. The snow is piled high across the mountain village, and at night the wind chill takes temperatures down to minus 20C and less.\n\nUltimately, the forum will be dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the worlds 500 largest companies scheduled to attend.\n\nBut much of the media focus will be on the political leaders coming to Davos, not least because the agenda of this years forum seems to lack an overarching theme. Taking responsibility for tough choices is this years official talking point, hinting at a welter of knotty problems. One thing seems sure, though: transatlantic disagreements over how to deal with Iran, Iraq and China are set to dominate discussions. Pointedly, only one senior official from President Bushs new administration is scheduled to attend. The US government may still make a conciliatory gesture, just as happened a year ago when Vice President Dick Cheney made a surprise appearance in Davos.\n\nUkraines new president, Viktor Yushchenko, is to speak, just days after his inauguration, an event that crowned the civil protests against the rigged first election that had tried to keep him from power.\n\nThe European Unions top leaders, among them German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and European Commission President Manuel Barosso, will be here too. Mr Blair will formally open the proceedings, although his speech will be pre-empted by French President Jacques Chirac, who announced his attendance at the last minute and secured a slot for a special message two hours before Mr Blair speaks. The organisers also hope that the new Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, will use the opportunity for talks with at least one of the three Israeli deputy prime ministers coming to the event, a list that includes Shimon Peres. Davos fans still hark back to 1994, when talks between Yassir Arafat and Mr Peres came close to a peace deal. Mr Blairs appearance will be keenly watched too, as political observers in the UK claim it is a calculated snub against political rival Chancellor Gordon Brown, who was supposed to lead the UK government delegation.\n\nMicrosoft founder Bill Gates, the worlds richest man and a regular at Davos, will focus on campaigning for good causes, though business interests will not be wholly absent either. Having already donated billions of dollars to the fight against Aids and Malaria, Mr Gates will call on world leaders to support a global vaccination campaign to protect children in developing countries from easily preventable diseases. On Tuesday, Mr Gates pledged $750m (£400m) of his own money to support the cause. Mr Gates company, software giant Microsoft, also hopes to use Davos to shore up its defences against open source software like Linux, which threaten Microsofts near monopoly on computer desktops. Mr Gates is said to be trying to arrange a meeting with Brazils President Lula da Silva. The Brazilian government has plans to switch all government computers from Microsoft to Linux. At Davos, global problem solving and networking are never far apart.\n	business
52	Brazil approves bankruptcy reform\n\nA major reform of Brazils bankruptcy laws has been approved by the countrys Congress, in a move which it is hoped will cut the cost of borrowing.\n\nThe bill, proposed in 1993, has finally been approved by the leadership of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The old law, dating from 1945, gave priority first to workers, second to tax revenue and finally to creditors. The new legislation changes this, giving priority to creditors and limiting payments to workers. The new regulations will limit payments to workers to 150 times the minimum monthly salary, which is currently $94. The law also makes it more difficult for a company to declare bankruptcy. However, when a firm is declared bankrupt it will gain protection from creditors for 180 days while a recovery plan is worked out.\n\nThe proposals were opposed in the past by leftist parties, including Mr Lulas Worker Party. They considered that they undermined workers rights. But President Lula became a defender of the reforms, arguing that the countrys bank lending margins were among the highest in the world and were damaging the economy. According to Andreas Adriano of Latin Trade Magazine, the new bankruptcy law will help in reducing the spread - difference between the interest rates of the banks and federal bonds. Nevertheless, Mr Adriano said to reduce the basic interest rate the Central Bank needs to change its policy, focusing not only on inflation but also on economic growth.\n	business
53	This is, ostensibly, a movie about multiple grief. As such, it ought to move viewers and make them empathetic with the plight of the main characters. However, its irritatingly postmodern style makes it almost incomprehensible. The camera continually switches from one scene to another, from one personal crisis to the next, creating a choppy, disjointed effect. Most characters appear to live aimless, unstructured lives, held together by their professional commitments. (It also stretches credibility that a man who has just been given what amounts to a likely death sentence, would cheerfully indulge in a sex romp with a woman he has just met). The storyline (if there is a storyline) is difficult to follow. In sum, the overall effect is rather disappointing. In spite of all that, the acting is generally good and some of the scenes are quite powerful.	movie
54	I recently caught up with this little gem of a film on cable. It took me by surprise, even though, I should have expected it from the team involved with this movie. Henry Bromwell directed this film with a sure hand, and it shows. One always wonders about the secret life of hit killers. One doesnt have to go too far to realize they probably are ones own neighbors, or social acquaintances, or even friends; theyre no different from us, at least on the surface.In this story, the grandfather, is a despicable character who does not hesitate in eliminating anyone for the right price. He has no scruples in teaching the ropes to his own son, and even to the grandson!Alex, is a man living in turmoil. He knows what he has done in the past and suddenly is coming to realize the consequence of his actions. He has to see someone to help him find peace with himself. In going to Dr. Parks, he is trying to find absolution, although, he doesnt find it there. On the contrary, there is a dramatic twist when Alex learns about who is supposed to kill next.Alex, brilliantly portrayed by William H. Macy, mesmerizes us. Not only is he a fantastic actor, but he makes us believe he is that man. One of the best things in the movie is the late John Ritter. He is equally convincing as Dr. Parks, the man who unravels the mystery.Donald Sutherland, as the grandfather is perfect. He is a natural actor in everything he does. Neve Campbell surprised in her pivotal role of Sarah. She shows a capability and range that are incredible. Tracey Ullman is Martha, the suffering wife, and she doesnt get to do much. Also Barbara Bain, in a rare appearance, is the grandmother from hell. David Dorfman, is a delight in the film. He shows a maturity beyond his years.	movie

55	US cyber security chief resigns\n\nThe man making sure US computer networks are safe and secure has resigned after only a year in his post.\n\nAmit Yoran was director of the National Cyber Security Division within the US Department of Homeland Security created following the 9/11 attacks. The division was tasked with improving US defences against malicious hackers, viruses and other net-based threats. Reports suggest he left because his division was not given enough clout within the larger organisation.\n\nMr Yoran took up his post in September 2003 and his first task was to get the Cyber Security Division up and running. The organisation had a staff of about 60 people and a budget of about $80m (£44.54m). The division was charged with thinking up and carrying out action to make US networks more impervious to attack and disruption by the viruses, worms and hack attacks that have become commonplace.\n\nIn the last 12 months Mr Yoran oversaw the creation of a cyber alert system that sends out warnings about big hitting viruses and net attacks as they occur. The warnings also contained information about how firms and organisations could protect themselves against these attacks. The Cyber Security Division also audited US government networks to discover exactly what was sitting on which network. The next step was to be the creation of a scanning system to identify vulnerabilities that made federal networks and machines susceptible to attack by malicious hackers and virus writers. Mr Yorans division was also doing work to identify the networks and machines that had been broken into by cyber criminals. Despite this success Mr Yoran left his post abruptly at the end of last week, reportedly only giving one days notice to bosses at the Department of Homeland Security. Amit Yoran has been a valuable contributor on cyber security issues over the past year, and we appreciate his efforts in starting the departments cybersecurity program, said a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman. Some reports have suggested that Mr Yoran felt frustrated by the lack of prominence given to work to protect against net-based threats in the wider homeland organisation. An attempt by US politicians to pass a law to promote Mr Yoran and raise the profile of his departments work is now mired in Congress.\n	tech
56	Beattie return calms attack fears\n\nEverton striker James Beattie has been declared fit for training on Tuesday, despite suffering an alleged assault last Saturday.\n\nBeattie, 27, is not believed to be as seriously hurt as some reports have suggested after being the victim of an unprovoked assault in Birmingham. He was on a night out with his girlfriend and two friends following Evertons 3-1 win over Aston Villa. He was shaken but not badly injured, said Everton spokesman Ian Ross. He added: He did speak to the police but will not be pressing charges. He has spoken to manager David Moyes about what happened. Beattie was suspended for the win at Aston Villa after his red card against Chelsea and he will be available again for the Merseyside derby at Liverpool on 20 March.\n	sport
57	Extremely tense thriller set in the urban chaos of São Paulo, the biggest and ugliest third world nightmare in Brazilian urbania. For the sake of making it easy for anyone who is curious about this intriguing and truly well made film, it has the grit of Mexican feature Amores Perros with a character not too far off Max Cady, from both Cape Fears, although this is not, by any means, a film about a psychopath. Two partners (Alexandre Borges and Marco Ricca) in a construction company pay hitman Anisio (Miklos) to off their third partner (and majority share holder) in said construction outfit. The murder is blamed on the city, but things begin to look very grim indeed when witty and charismatic walking nightmare Anisio decides he wants to be around the ever so nervous partners in crime, not only trespassing but, more importantly, deconstructing the strict social codes that make up Brazilian society. Anisio turns poverty into an attitude and he wants in. The look is almost entirely handheld, grainy, the performances outstanding throughout, especially so as first time actor (and member of classic Brazilian pop band Titãs), Paulo Miklos, dazzles and baffles the viewer with his pretty funny social terror.I saw the film at the Brasília film Fest in November 2001. It has since done very well in Sundance and Berlin. Kleber Mendonça Filho	movie
58	Deutsche Boerse boosts dividend\n\nDeutsche Boerse, the German stock exchange that is trying to buy its London rival, has said it will boost its 2004 dividend payment by 27%.\n\nAnalysts said that the move is aimed at winning over investors opposed to its bid for the London Stock Exchange. Critics of the takeover have complained that the money could be better used by returning cash to shareholders. Deutsche Boerse also said profit in the three months to 31 December was 120.7m euros ($158.8m; £83.3m). Sales climbed to 364.4m euros, lifting revenue for the year to a record 1.45bn euros.\n\nFrankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse has offered £1.3bn ($2.48bn; 1.88bn euros) for the London Stock Exchange. Rival pan-European bourse Euronext is working also on a bid. Late on Monday, Deutsche Boerse said it would lift its 2004 dividend payment to 70 euro cents (£0.48; $0.98) from 55 euro cents a year earlier. There is a whiff of a sweetener in there, Anais Faraj, an analyst at Nomura told the BBCs World Business Report. Most of the disgruntled shareholders of Deutsche Boerse are complaining that the money that is being used for the bid could be better placed in their hands, paid out in dividends, Mr Faraj continued. Deutsche Boerse is trying to buy them off in a sense, he said.\n	business

60	This British-Spanish co-production is one of the countless films shot in Spain in the wake of the unexpected phenomenal success enjoyed by the Italian Spaghetti Westerns and, as is typical of such genre efforts, features an eclectic assortment of established and emerging international stars: Robert Shaw, Telly Savalas, Stella Stevens, Martin Landau, Fernando Rey, Michael Craig, Al Lettieri, Dudley Sutton, Antonio Mayans, etc. Ironically, however, this incoherent mess of a movie serves as a shining example as to why that most American of film genres became a dying breed in the 1970s and is nowadays practically (or is that officially?) extinct.I really wanted to like this film, not only because the Western is one of my favorite types of movies but also because it had all the qualities, including an intriguing premise, to be a good one - not to mention the fact that my father had purchased a paperback edition of A TOWN CALLED BASTARDs novelization following its original release! As it is, the films sole virtue (if, indeed, it can even be called that) is its sheer eccentricity: for instance, Stevens, playing a widow out for revenge on the man who betrayed her revolutionary husband, sleeps inside a coffin(!) driven around in a carriage by her dumb manservant(?) Sutton; Savalas, as a blood-thirsty renegade, who at first appears to be the films main villain, is unceremoniously dispatched by his own henchman Lettieri very early on in the picture; the villain of the piece, then, turns out to be Landau who, in the films very first scene, is seen pillaging side-by-side our legendary hero-turned-priest Shaw!; Fernando Rey, playing a blind peasant, is the only one who can identify rebel Shaw who, in the end turns out to have been merely a front for...well, nevermind! As you can see, the plot is very confusing and it gets stranger from there! The production team responsible for this film were also behind other Western fare around the same period of time, like CUSTER OF THE WEST (1967), BAD MANS RIVER (1971), CAPTAIN APACHE (1971) and PANCHO VILLA (1972).	movie

63	Holmes back on form in Birmingham\n\nDouble Olympic champion Kelly Holmes was back to her best as she comfortably won the 1,000m at the Norwich Union Birmingham Indoor Grand Prix.\n\nThe 34-year-old, running only her second competitive race of the season, shook off the rust to win in two minutes, 35.39 seconds. But she is still undecided about competing in the European Championships in Madrid from 4-6 March. Ill probably be entered and make my mind up at the last minute, she said. My training hasnt gone as well as expected but Ive got two weeks to decide. I need to take my time and make sure I feel good about what Im doing. I felt very good here but with the crowd behind you, you feel like you can do anything. American\n\nwas the eventual winner of the mens 60m race which almost ended in farce. Three athletes were disqualified for false starting, including Britains Mark Lewis-Francis, who was the first man guilty of coming out of his blocks too quickly. World 100m champion Kim Collins clinched second spot ahead of world 60m record holder and Scotts training partner Maurice Greene. Jason Gardeners unbeaten run came to an end as he came fifth and he will need to improve if he is to defend his European title in Madrid. You cant win them all, said Gardener afterwards. And I was very disappointed as I know Im capable of doing better. Russian\n\nwas back on record-breaking form in the pole vault at the National Indoor Arena.\n\nThe Olympic champion set a new world mark of 4.88m to break her own record - which she set just six days ago - and beat Russian rival Svetlana Feofanova. It was Isinbayevas 11th world record - indoors or out - since July 2003. Im so happy and I will do my best to break the 5m barrier soon, the 22-year-old told BBC Sport. Jamaicas\n\nstormed to a personal best of 7.13 seconds to claim the womens 60m sprint. Belgian Kim Gevaert, who will be one of the favourites for next months European title, took second while American Muna Lee was third. There was disappointment for British pair Jeanette Kwakye and Joice Maduaka who finished seventh and eighth respectively.\n\nJamaican\n\nstretched her unbeaten record to 25 races as she effortlessly claimed the 200m. The Olympic champion set a new indoor personal best of 22.38 seconds - the fastest time in the world this season.\n\nfought off fellow Briton Tim Abeyie to take the mens 200m in a personal best of 20.88.\n\ncontinued her outstanding start to the season, beating a strong international field, which included two-time Olympic 100m hurdles bronze medallist Melissa Morrison, to claim the womens 60m hurdles. The 25-year-old Briton clocked 7.98 seconds while pre-European Championships favourite Russian Irina Shevchenko finished down in sixth. Ethiopias\n\nfailed in her bid to smash compatriot Berhane Aderes world 3,000m record but still won the event in emphatic style. The Olympic 5,000m champion was inside record pace but dropped off over the final third, finishing in eight minutes, 33.05 seconds - the fourth fastest time ever recorded for the event. Britains Jo Pavey bravely decided to go with Defar as she strode away from the field and took second in a seasons best 8:41.43. Kenyan\n\nalso missed out on the indoor 1500m world record, which Hicham El Guerrouj has held for the last eight years.\n\nLagat settled for silver behind El Guerrouj in Athens and was almost four seconds short of the Moroccans world best, clocking 3:35.27 in Birmingham. And\n\nwas still struggling to find his form after the death of his fiancee this year. The Olympic 10,000m champion had comfortably led the mens two mile race after his younger brother Tariku had set the pace. But fellow Ethiopian\n\nappeared ominously on Bekeles shoulder with two laps to go before surging past him at the bell to win in 8:14.28. Jamaican\n\nmade the most of a blistering start to take the mens 400m title in 45.91 seconds. World indoor champion, Alleyne Francique, faded badly and finished in fourth while American duo Jerry Harris and James Davis took second and third respectively. Swede\n\nshowed her class in the long jump as she stole top spot from Jade Johnson with the very last jump of the competition. The Olympic heptathlon gold medallist reached 6.66m to better Johnsons mark of 6.52m - her second personal best inside a week. I was quite surprised because I didnt think Id end up with second place, said Johnson, who wore Londons 2012 Olympic bid slogan, Back the Bid, on her shorts. But Im pleased and hopefully Ill get a bit better for the Europeans. I really want to win a medal.\n\nwon the mens event with a seasons best of 7.95m, taking the scalp of world indoor champion Savante Stringfellow of the USA.\n	sport
64	Split-caps pay £194m compensation\n\nInvestors who lost money following the split-capital investment trust scandal are to receive £194m compensation, the UKs financial watchdog has announced.\n\nEighteen investment firms involved in the sale of the investments agreed the compensation package with the Financial Services Authority (FSA). Splits were marketed as a low-risk way to benefit from rising share prices. But when the stock market collapsed in 2000, the products left thousands of investors out of pocket. An estimated 50,000 people took out split-capital funds, some investing their life savings in the schemes. The paying of compensation will be overseen by an independent company, the FSA said.\n\nFurther details of how investors will be able to claim their share of the compensation package will be announced in the new year. This should save investors from having to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, something, no doubt, that will be very welcome, Rob McIvor, FSA spokesman, told BBC News. Agreeing to pay compensation did not mean that the eighteen firms involved were admitting any guilt, the FSA added. Any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service.\n\nThe FSA has been investigating whether investors were misled about the risks posed by split-capital investment trusts. The FSAs 60 strong investigation team looked into whether fund managers colluded in a so-called magic circle, in the hope of propping up one anothers share prices.\n\nFirms involved were presented with 780 files of evidence detailing 27,000 taped conversations and over 70 interviews. In May, the FSA was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to £350m in compensation. Mr McIvor told the BBC that the final settlement figure was smaller because two unnamed firms had pulled out of the compensation negotiations. Investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the courts.\n	business

68	Student inequality exposed\n\nTeenagers from well-off backgrounds are six times more likely to go to university than those from the most deprived areas, a report says.\n\nThe Higher Education Funding Council for England said more people went to university between 1994 and 2000. But the percentage of poorer students hardly changed at all, said its chief executive, Sir Howard Newby. Increasingly more women than men went to university, while tuition fees and student loans made no major difference.\n\nThe Hefce report, drawing on child benefits data, said teenagers in the richest areas could expect a better than 50% chance of going to university, while in the poorest neighbourhoods it was 10%. Participation at constituency level ranged from 69% in Kensington and Chelsea, 65% in the City of London and Westminster and 62% in Sheffield Hallam, down to 10% in Bristol South and Leeds Central and 8% in Nottingham North and Sheffield Brightside.\n\nSir Howard said the report highlighted the entrenched divisions between rich and poor areas, but added it was a social as much as an educational problem. He told BBC News: We know, once children from deprived backgrounds get into university, they do very well. In fact surprisingly more go into postgraduate study than those from more affluent backgrounds. The issue is, I think, one of raising aspirations amongst those families and those communities that university is something for them and not for other people.\n\nHe said by the time universities traditionally dealt with pupils, between the ages of 16 and 18, it was too late. Instead they should be reaching out to communities and schools much earlier, even down to primary school level, to persuade them a university education was something they could aspire to, he said. But while the report revealed stark inequalities and exposed the extent of the challenge, there were some encouraging findings, he added.\n\nTuition fees and student loans in England and Wales - and the different fee regime in Scotland - did not seem to have affected the choices of young people, even the poorest. The report also showed women were 18% more likely than men to enter higher education in 2000 - up from 6% in 1994. In the poorest areas, the gap was 30% in womens favour and growing faster than anywhere else. The Higher Education Minister, Kim Howells, said: We are working in schools to raise the attainment and aspiration of young people in disadvantaged areas. Higher standards in schools would lead to greater participation in higher education. From 2006 upfront tuition fees in England would be removed, with grants for the less well off. The shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, said: It is clear from this report that children from disadvantaged areas are far more likely to have encountered poor standards in their secondary education. Tackling these must be the top priority for any government looking to improve university access. The group which represents university vice-chancellors, Universities UK, said the new system of deferred fees in England, due to start in 2006, with grants and bursaries for poorer students, would encourage more of them to go into higher education. The National Union of Students argued the opposite - that the situation was likely to get much worse, with poorer students being restricted in choice and having to make decisions based on their financial situation rather than aspiration.\n\nThe tables below show the participation rate for each Parliamentary constituency in Britain:\n	politics

73	Brown ally rejects Budget spree\n\nChancellor Gordon Browns closest ally has denied suggestions there will be a Budget giveaway on 16 March.\n\nEd Balls, ex-chief economic adviser to the Treasury, said there would be no spending spree before polling day. But Mr Balls, a prospective Labour MP, said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules. He was speaking as Sir Digby Jones, CBI director general, warned Mr Brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on pre-election bribes.\n\nMr Balls, who stepped down from his Treasury post to stand as a Labour candidate in the election, had suggested that Mr Brown would meet his golden economic rule - with a margin to spare. He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules.\n\nHe also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Partys chances of winning. Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising. Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January. If the MPC (the Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee) were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and Im not predicting that they will - I do not believe that this will be a big election issue in Britain for Labour, he told a Parliamentary lunch. This is a big change in our political culture.\n\nDuring an interview with BBC Radio 4s Today programme, Mr Balls said he was sure Mr Browns Budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy. I dont think well see a pre-election spending spree - we certainly did not see that before 2001, he said.\n\nHis assurances came after Sir Digby Jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers skills. His message to the chancellor was: Please dont give it away in any form of electioneering. Sir Digby added: I dont think he will. I have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through. Stability is the key word - British business needs boring stability more than anything. We would say to him dont increase your public spending, dont give it away. But if you are going to anywhere, just add something to the competitiveness of Britain, put it into skilling our people. That would be a good way to spend any excess.\n\nMr Balls refused to say whether Mr Brown would remain as chancellor after the election, amid speculation he will be offered the job of Foreign Secretary. I think that Gordon Brown wants to be part of the successful Labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a Conservative Party that will take Britain backwards, Mr Balls told Today. Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May.\n	politics

75	Wow, this is very unusual in one regard: usually the first movie in a long string of sequels is the best of the bunch. People are surprised when a sequel is actually better. With Tarzan, I thought this movie was the worst of the bunch, or at least the first six which comprise my Tarzan Collection DVD package. I will gladly watch the sequels multiple times but I am through sitting through this turkey, thanks to several characters.Well, lets start with the good news first:THE GOOD - Plenty of action with a lot of wild animals on display, even if they are just stock footage. You see lion attacks, crocodiles, hippos, panthers, you name it, and you see several of the different tribes of all kinds, including pygmies (called dwarfs in the movie.) Since this movie was made almost 75 years ago, I cant knock any of the realism because they didnt have it in the movies that long ago. They do the best they can so you put up with actors talking in front of fake backgrounds. However, Weissmuller did a lot of action scenes and was in great shape. He and OSullivan make a well-built handsome couple, if there ever was one in those Golden Years of cinema.The film has historical value (with so many sequels) in that it shows how Tarzan acquired Jane and his beginnings of learning the English language.The BAD - From the moment Jane Parker is taken by Tarzan almost every scene with her is Maureen OSullivan in hysterics, shrieking and screaming scene after scene. Its enough to give you a headache and it ruins the film. Thankfully, she calmed down in the sequels, but not in this movie. The movie also does no favors for The Great White Hunter image as C. Aubrey Smith, playing Janes father, and Neil Hamilton, as Harry Holt, the safari guide, shoot at every animal within sight, whether the beasts is threatening or not. These people are kill- happy, particularly Smith. On another note, its too bad there isnt anything in here explaining how Tarzan got to be in the jungle in the first place. There is no history of him in here or footage of his growing up. Hes just there when Jane and the group get to a certain point in Africa.	movie
76	Game makers get Xbox 2 sneak peek\n\nMicrosoft has given game makers a glimpse of the new Xbox 2 console.\n\nSome details of the Xboxs performance and what gaming will be like with the device were given at the annual Game Developers Conference in the US. Xbox frontman J. Allard said the console looked set to be capable of one trillion calculations per second. Also all titles for the new Xbox will have the same interface to make it easy to play online and buy extras for characters or other add-ons for games.\n\nMicrosoft is saving the official unveiling of the Xbox 2, codenamed Xenon, for the E3 show in May and the device could be on shop shelves by November. However, during his keynote speech at GDC Mr Allard, who heads development of game-making tools for the console, gave a glimpse into how some of its core software will work. He said gaming was entering a high-definition era that demanded detailed and convincing graphics that could adequately compete with the HDTV people were starting to watch as well as the HD DVDs that will soon start to appear.\n\nIndustry watchers took this to mean that the Xbox 2 will push for HDTV quality graphics as standard as well as multi-channel audio to give gamers an authentic experience. Mr Allard said Microsoft had to work hard to ensure that it was easy for game makers to produce titles for the Xbox 2 and for players to get playing. To this end Microsoft was building in to Xbox hardware systems to support headset chat, buddy list controls and custom soundtracks so developers were free to concentrate on the games. The Xbox would also support well-known industry specifications, such as DirectX, to make it simple for game studios to make titles for the console. For gamers this emphasis on ease of use would mean every Xbox title uses the same interface to set up online play and get at music stored on the hardware. This interface will hold details of a players statistics and skill level on a gamer card as well as give access to a store where people can spend small amounts of cash to buy extras for their avatars or add-ons, such as new maps or vehicles, for games they possess. This ability to personalise games and in-game characters would be key in the future, said Mr Allard. Only with such consistency would the Xbox be able to support the 10-20 million subscribers that it was aiming for, said Mr Allard. During his speech Mr Allard took several swipes at the Playstation and said processors for consoles had to be made with developers, not just engineers, in mind. Our approach is Bruce Lee, not brute force, he said.\n	tech
77	As Jennifer Denuccio used to say on Square Pegs, Gag me out the door. I would definitely vote this movie on IMDBs Worst movie list.Dennis Christopher plays T.T., a guy from Chicago who goes to California peddling his brothers jazz records. He is supposed to be a barney placed in the locals-only surfing community. But he acts more like he is new to civilization (just try to get through his sex scene without squirming). There are also the on-going adventures of the rest of the local population that the viewer must endure. That of Duke (Seymour Cassell), the volleyball expert who tries to get T.T. to act like a normal human being, the obnoxious drunk surfers who cheat on their girlfriends, and the guy who makes a bet with another that he can live in car for sixth months.California Dreaming is just a big old mess. It starts out like a typical seventies romp, complete with bad 70s music (even though this movie came out one year shy of the 80s). And Dennis Christopher comes off as the most irritable loser, it makes the movie hard to watch (keep your finger on the fast forward button). Even if this movie was supposed to be about the surfer culture, the surf scenes are almost total garbage. The people at the surf contest look as though they cant keep from falling asleep.I guess the only cool thing is seeing Tanya Roberts outside of her role as Midge on the sitcom Thats 70s show. And Cassell wasnt bad, he was just in a bad movie.	movie

The agreement is the latest in a string of deals reached by Qatar, which is trying to make itself a regional leader in natural gas. US oil giant ExxonMobil signed up for a $12.8bn deal earlier on Sunday. Frances Total is expected to join the ExxonMobil scheme, dubbed Qatargas-2, on Monday, taking 5 million tonnes of LNG a year. ExxonMobil will be taking some 15 million tonnes each year for 25 years from the end of 2007 under the deal. Shells agreement, under the name Qatargas-4, foresees the building of new facilities to handle 1.4 billion cubic feet of gas, and 7.8 million tonnes of LNG each year from 2011 onwards.\n	business
79	I went out of my way to get this film, and was fortunate to get it on VHS. Being a big Gloria Grahame fan, it was an excellent addition to my collection. Other than that, I really cannot say a lot to recommend this picture. The plot is predictable (and weak) and the only interesting aspect of the film is watching Sterling Hayden get into deeper trouble with his own department. Ms. Grahame is always fun to watch (if you like her, as I do), but the dubbing of her singing hurts this picture a lot. She works in a dive, so let her use her own voice. It can only lend to the atmosphere. I must agree with an earlier reviewer; the ending borrows heavily from THE BIG HEAT. To the point of detracting from the ending. I have seen worse films with Ms. Grahame (MACAO), but I will never pass the opportunity to see her on screen. If you are having a movie night and looking for a second feature film, this is your movie. Enjoy the picture.	movie

No twists (they think they have one, but if you didnt figure it out after about 40mins youre not too bright). Lots of well know actors in roles and performances that, fortunately for everyone involved, will be forgotten as soon as the end credits roll.I dont mind slow movies, but theyve got to be going _somewhere_. This one doesnt.The plot wasnt what made this a direct-to-DVD movie, thats just a rather convenient excuse to try and drum up some fake controversy.The as-of-writing 37(!) ten (10) ratings must be from people involved with the production.	movie
82	Okay. You saw the film and I saw the film. True? If not, there are plenty of plot summaries out there, and there is absolutely no reason for us to waste time on any feeble attempts of mine to create another.The most stunning aspect of the film is unquestionably the performances by the two young men and the young lady in the leads. Their emotional honesty was as compelling, if not more so, than any performances Ive seen in recent months. I found I laughed, cried and cringed right along with them, and thats saying a great deal because Im often called a jaded and cynical jerk.As one would expect, the story is rife with clichés and I suppose thats the Achilles heel of the picture. Its a story weve all seen many times before; we all know how it will end from the moment they introduce Rory. Though you may not know exact mechanics, you know there will be a transformative friendship, a bittersweet romance and a gut-wrenching conclusion. If it werent for the strong cast and directing, this film would be nothing more than the soporific swill that comprises eighty percent of the Hallmark Channels program schedule.	movie
83	World tour for top video gamers\n\nTwo UK gamers are about to embark on a world tour as part of the most lucrative-ever global games tournament.\n\nAaron Foster and David Treacy have won the right to take part in a tournament offering $1m in total prize money. The cash will be handed out over 10 separate competitions in a continent-hopping contest organised by the Cyberathlete Professional League. As part of their prize the pair will have their travel costs paid to ensure they can get to the different bouts.\n\nThe CPL World Tour kicks off in mid-February and the first leg will be in Istanbul. All ten bouts of the tournament will be played throughout 2005, each one in a different country. At each stop $50,000 in prize money will be up for grabs. The tournament champion for each leg of the CPL World Tour will walk away with a $15,000 prize. The winner of the grand final will get a prize purse of $150,000 from a total pot of $500,000.\n\nWinners of each stage of the tour automatically get a place at the next stop. The world tour stops are open to any keen gamer that registers. Online registration for the first stop opens this weekend. Some pro-players are winning a spot at the tour destinations through qualifying events organised by CPL partners. Winners at these qualifiers get seeded higher in the elimination parts of each tournament. Mr Foster and Mr Treacy get the chance to attend the World Tour as members of the UKs Four-Kings gaming clan. Towards the end of 2004 Four-Kings staged a series of online Painkiller competitions to reveal the UKs top players of the PC game. The best eight players met face-to-face in a special elimination event in late December where Mr Foster and Mr Tracey proved their prowess at Painkiller. As part of their prize the pair also get a contract with Four-Kings Intel which is one of the UKs few pro-gaming teams. There are a lot of people who take gaming very seriously and support their local or national team with the same passion as any other sport, said Simon Bysshe who filmed the event for Four-Kings and Intel. More than 80,000 people have downloaded the movie of the tournament highlights. Professional gaming is here to stay and will only grow in popularity, he said.\n	tech

Samsung is set to steal some initial limelight with the launch of a 7-megapixel phone on the opening day.\n\nThe SCH-V770 has some of the features of high-end digital single lens reflex cameras such as manual focus and the ability to attach a telephoto or wide-angle lens. Camera phones are likely to prove an interesting battle ground at the show, said Ben Wood, principal analyst at research firm Gartner. It is firmly established that cameras are an integral part of phones and now the technology arms race is on in terms of megapixels. There will be a certain amount of look how big mine is, he said. There will also be increasing focus on music-enabled mobiles. At 3GSM in Cannes everyone went music mad and music is going to be a big theme for all the vendors at Cebit, said Mr Wood. Sony Ericsson will use the fair to show off the W800 - its recently unveiled Walkman branded phone - and there is speculation that Motorola may unveil its ROKR handset, widely tipped as the first to carry Apples iTunes music software. Apple and Motorola announced they were getting together at the end of last year as a result of a long-standing friendship between Motorolas chief executive Ed Zander and Steve Jobs.\n\nSome analysts think Motorola may save the launch for CTIA, a wireless show in America the following week, which could be a telling sign about how operators are coming to view the German tech fair.\n\nOne of the interesting things is that CeBIT is clearly a show in decline, said Mr Wood. A lot of the big players, such as Nokia, are pulling back saying it is hard to justify a big presence at all of the shows. It could be the last big year for Cebit, he said. Other themes include TV-enabled mobiles which are bound to create a buzz in the halls as Vodafone unveils a prototype handset that can show live digital television. There has been a glut of recent headlines about mobile TV - French operators are teaming up, O2 is trialling a system in Oxford, UK, and Nokia begins trialling a system in Finland with the Finnish Broadcasting Company, YLE TV and commercial TV channels. Cebit could become the battleground for the two competing methods for getting TV on to mobiles, and is also likely to provide a stage for a technology slated to compete with 3G. HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access) has been described as 3G on steroids and could offer consumers much faster download times. For instance, a song which currently takes one and a half minutes to download to a phone could be done in 10 seconds. Korean giants LG Electronics and Samsung will show off HSDPA handsets at the show and the technology is set to be rolled out in the US, Europe and Korea next year. Broadband will continue to be a key theme at the show with internet telephony proving this years killer application.\n\nGermanys largest online service provider, T-Online, is tipped to reveal software for low-cost net telephony which would see it competing with its parent company Deutsche Telekom. Cebit is used by many to unveil cutting edge products and in the mobile sphere this is likely to mean a lot of bright, colourful handsets as fashion continues to compete with technology when it comes to the device everyone has in their pockets. Rainbow-coloured phones, influenced by handsets from Japan, are just one example of how Asian companies will stamp their mark on this years show, at which they will have their biggest ever presence. Cebit organisers have created a digital home in Hall 25 of the 27 hangar-like buildings that will house the show. The digital home will be a hyped theme at the show. The house will be totally wired and full of things that can be used for home entertainment, said Cebit organiser Gabriele Dorries.\n	tech
86	There is no way on earth you are going to care about any of these characters. A bunch of spoilt middle class overgrown kids take some drugs at a party and get off with each other and argue. Ive just seen this on TV and I didnt think it was a film as such, more a post-This Life indulgence that really has no resonance or proper drama to it. Stuff like this will get commissioned for time immemorial unfortunately, irrelevant middle class lifestyle crap that takes itself far too seriously. Its got David Baddiel in it and that bird out of Cold Feet, you know what to expect. There was a lot of this stuff about in 2000, it was a particularly British malaise...theyre educated and doing drugs? friends, but kinda dysfunctional and with incestuous relationships? sounds great!. This kind of nonsense, and post-Guy Ritchie comedy- gangster stuff...dark days. If you have taste, this will annoy you to the point of violence.	movie

88	Yes this movie is predictable and definitely not award-material. But then it doesnt try to be anything it is not. A fun-filled romp with real funny one-liners, a stellar and very funny performance by Peter OToole, a grounding and down to earth performance from Joan Plowright. The bands performance was on the spot, each one playing their role in a deft, comical manner. The music was good though not great but filled out the movie nicely. From some of the negative comments I deduced that the subtlety of some of the humour went over their heads. A good example is the comment about the strange baseball-like game, well my dear American, that was cricket -from which baseball is derived- and the explaining of it to the ignorant US band was very funny for those that do know cricket. Also no, you were not supposed to wince when Carl broke a window; it was funny how Lord Foxley said oh yes! to get more money for breakage and the manager said at the same time oh no also referring to the money. Jeez, it seems that every joke must be explained to some people... All-in-all I enjoyed it and had some great laughs! Well worth seeing.	movie
89	Henry, a veterinarian (Paul Rudd), and his bossy fiancé, Kate (Eva Longoria) are looking over the last minute arrangements for their reception. It is the morning of their wedding and Kate is in a frenzy, giving the caterers an earful about her demands for food presentation. But, horror of horrors, the angel ice sculpture, ordered by Kate, arrives without wings. In an ensuing fight with the sculptor, the heavy ice maiden falls on Kate and sends her to the hereafter. Now, one year later, Henrys sister arranges for a psychic to tell the young vet that Kate would have wanted him to starting dating other ladies and move forward. Yet, the lovely medium, Ashley (Lake Bell) becomes interested in Henry herself, much to the chagrin of her catering partner (Jason Biggs). More importantly, Kate returns from the other side to create havoc for Ashley, as she has no intentions of letting another woman get her hands on Henry. Can anything be done to return Kate into heaven for good? This is an abysmal romantic comedy, one of the worst this dedicated fan has ever seen. No, its not the cast, as they try gamely to make things work. Longoria is beautiful and funny as the overbearing fiancé and Bell has an offbeat style and humor that is likewise infectious. Biggs, a funny thespian, too, is totally wasted. As for Rudd, a very gifted performer (see Anchorman, Knocked Up, or Clueless, please) he tries hardest of all and, in truth, is the main reason to see this clunker. His charm, looks, and easy wit go a long way in making the film bearable. But, nothing can turn a mindless script and terrible direction into a winner, absolutely nothing. So, if you are a dyed-in-the-wool fan of romantic comedy, think long and hard before you fork over any money for this one. Even were free tickets to fall into your lap, be warned that this movie is a near-death experience for those who adore love-and-laugh cinema.	movie

91	There is a reason why the world forgot these creatures: they are dull. This is a Hammer Production which means that whoever made this movie should be struck with a hammer, several times if possible - and where it most hurts. Most people put more thought into taking a dump than these idiots have put into making this movie.Seriously now The movie begins with some cavemen hunting an antelope-thing. Now, antelopes must have evolved a lot from those pre-historic times because they actually attack and kill people here. After that, its time to meet the rest of the tribe: more bearded men, some fashion-models, and even a couple of very old, grey-haired grannies and grandpas. These old geezers obviously never heard about cave people not surpassing the age of 30; they refused to bow to the will of both logic and pre-historical records, so they remain alive. One of the cavemen isnt bearded; he is clean-shaven. Not quite as clean-shaven as Tarzan, The Lord of the Humanoid Clean-Shaven Ones Roaming the Jungle Since Childhood And Without a Razor, but thereabouts.What follows is the obligatory earthquake/molten-lava destruction sequence which causes a lot of our not-so-hairy friends to meet their doom. It is interesting to note that before the earthquake the fashion-models showed their breasts more. After it, they must have gotten shy or something, because they covered their chests for a while (maybe they were covered by ash so I mistakenly thought they were covered). More action follows in the form of two fashion-models wrestling in the sand; the next-best thing to female mud-wrestling, I suppose. After a good deal of the desert has been crossed, our black-haired tribe meets - how else could it be - a blond tribe. Yawn.More spellbinding stuff follows. There is that redhead fashion-model who is bothered by seeing a cave-teen kill a hedge-hog-thing. There is also the scene of a woman dying at birth: those cave-fashion-models are so frail. Eventually we get to meet an even darker -haired and -skinned tribe, i.e. an evil tribe. One of them becomes a WWF champion after he actually beats(!) a huge bear-thing in a wrestling bout. 1,2,3... and its done: the bear is the loser. We also witness a jealous caveman miraculously recover from two major injuries: first he gets stabbed with a big spear into the thigh, yet he walks away from that as if it were but a scratch. Then he gets thrown off a cliff - onto a big rock - by the blond goodie-two-shoes caveman, yet he walks away from it as if he were thrown onto a giant sofa. Its unclear in the end whether he dies from falling off an even higher cliff or from that voodoo doll being crushed. Oh yes, voodoo was used in pre-historic times by white tribes that live in the desert and whose females were fashion-models. Its always important to learn from movies.The message of the movie is as insightful as it is educational: cave people liked to fight for local power and they loved their fashion-models, too. As if any self-respecting caveman would fight to be leader of such a sorry bunch.	movie

92	England claim Dubai Sevens glory\n\nEngland beat Fiji 26-21 in a dramatic final in Dubai to win the first IRB Sevens event of the season.\n\nHaving beaten Australia and South Africa to reach the final, England fell behind to an early try against Fiji. They then took charge with scores from Pat Sanderson, Kai Horstman, Mathew Tait and Rob Thirlby, but Fiji rallied to force a tense finale. Scotland were beaten 33-15 by Samoa in the plate semi-final and Ireland lost 17-5 to Tunisia in the shield final. Mike Fridays England side matched their opponents for pace, power and skill in the final and led 19-7 at half-time. But Neumi Nanuku and Marika Vakacegu touched down for Fiji, only for a needless trip by Tuidriva Bainivalu on Geoff Appleford to allow England to run down the clock. To be honest, England have wanted to win in Dubai for a very long time now, and the people here have wanted us to win for just as long, said Friday.\n\nWe didnt want to put pressure on ourselves but we are thankful we have achieved that and brought through some young talent at the same time that can hopefully play for the England 15s in a few years. Portugal confirmed their impressive progress in Sevens rugby by recording a sudden-death win over France in the bowl final. Samoa won the plate title by edging out Argentina 21-19.\n\n	sport
93	Car giant hit by Mercedes slump\n\nA slump in profitability at luxury car maker Mercedes has prompted a big drop in profits at parent DaimlerChrysler.\n\nThe German-US carmaker saw fourth quarter operating profits fall to 785m euros ($1bn) from 2.4bn euros in 2003. Mercedes-Benzs woes - its profits slid to just 20m euros - obscured a strong performance from the Chrysler group whose returns met market expectations. Mercedes faces fierce competition in the luxury car sector from BMW and but hopes to revive its fortunes by 2006.\n\nMercedes profits over the period compared unfavourably with 2003s 784m euro figure and were well below analyst expectations of 374m euros. For the year as a whole, its operating profits fell 46% to 1.6bn euros. Sales of Mercedes brands fell 2% as demand cooled, while revenues were affected by the weakness of the US dollar.\n\nThe carmaker blamed the fall in profits on high launch costs for new models and losses from its Mercedes Smart mini-car range. Mercedes is hoping to increase productivity by 3bn euros, having negotiated 500m euros in annual savings with German workers last year. The firm said it was determined to retain Mercedes position as the worlds most successful luxury brand. However, DaimlerChryslers shares fell 1.5% on the news. While all these divisions are doing well the big worries continue to surround Mercedes-Benz, Michael Rabb, an analyst with Bank Sal Oppenheim, told Reuters.\n\nIn contrast, Chrysler enjoyed a 5% annual increase in unit sales while revenues - calculated in US dollars - rose 10%. The US division - whose marques include Dodge and Jeep - transformed a full year operating loss of 506m euros in 2003 into a 1.4bn euros profit last year.\n\nOverall, DaimlerChrysler saw worldwide vehicle sales rise 8% to 4.7 million in 2004 while total revenues added 4% to 142bn euros. Chryslers strong performance helped the worlds fifth largest carmaker boost net income by 400m euros to 2.5bn euros.\n\nThe year 2004 shows that our strategy works well - even in such a challenging competitive environment, said Jurgen Schrempp, DaimlerChryslers chairman. DaimlerChrysler took a 475m euro hit in costs stemming from a defects scandal at its joint venture, Japanese subsidiary Fuso. DaimlerChrysler last week agreed a compensation package with partner Mitsubishi Motors which will see it buy out its stake in Fuso. Looking forward, DaimerChryslers profits are expected to be slightly higher in 2005. However, it is expecting significant improvements in profitability in 2006 as a result of a major investment in the Mercedes product range.\n	business

96	This is a German film from 1974 that is something to do with some women who come to a castle and beyond that, I cant really tell you their purpose or even what the purpose of the movie is. I can tell you that theres several women who also moonlight as servants at this particular castle who strip, put on body paint and gyrate to bongos like they were at the Goth Kit-Kat Klub, though, and that seems to be a good portion of the run time of this film. Yeah, there seems to be something with devil worship and vampires, and theres some girl on girl stuff, etc., but the main focus seems to be the painted babes gyrating away in the basement. I did rather like the eye-rolling of one of the main housekeepers/devil worshipers, that lent an authenticity to the proceedings and made her even more evil-looking. Was that Wanda the Evil Lesbian (as billed in the credits)? No matter. If you arent too picky about your lesbian devil worshiping movies, you might like this, otherwise its pretty dull stuff and I couldnt even finish it, I was so bored. 3 out of 10.	movie
97	Moreno debut makes Oscar mark\n\nCatalina Sandino Moreno has joined a rare group of actresses who have been nominated for an Oscar for starring in a foreign language film.\n\nThe Colombian-born actress was the final hope for director Joshua Marston, who scoured the US and Colombia for a lead for Maria Full of Grace. The film sees the 23-year-old play a teenage drug mule who smuggles heroin by swallowing pellets in condoms. Plaudits have been raining down on her for her gritty performance, making it all the more surprising that this is her first film. Her previous acting experience was in amateur productions in her home city of Bogota at the Ruben Di Pietro theatre academy. She has already received a nomination for the Independent Spirit Awards leading actress category but these rarely overlap with Academy Awards, instead recognising quirkier, low-budget films. And at the 2004 Berlin Film Festival the jury could not choose between her and Charlize Therons Oscar winning performance in Monster so gave them a tied award. Sandino Moreno is now being regarded as one of the most promising actresses around at the moment. But she is taking her time committing to her next project, hoping to land a strong Spanish script and would love to be able to work with directors Pedro Almodovar or Alejandro Amenabar.\n	entertainment
98	As you may have gathered from the title, I wholeheartedly believe this movie to be the worst zombie movie of all time. The acting, camera-work, writing, special effects and anything else remotely related to this movie sucked. People have argued that while this movie is terribly-acted and terribly-produced but it comes through with a witty intelligent script. Wow. The plot has more holes than I or anyone else could possibly count. For starters, why would the government tell everyone to go back to work when its not safe? I know the governments supposed to be evil but they dont gain anything by killing the entire population of the country. There wouldnt be anyone to govern! Another thing that I was wondering about, even if the government told everyone to go to work, why would people go if the streets were swarming with zombies? Were the zombies going to hide in the bushes and ambush the unsuspecting people in order to aid the government in their plot to kill everyone on the planet? And how about the ending? That stupid Torch guy sacrifices his life in order to get a few close up shots of the zombies. He probably forgot that every camera made in the last 35 years has a zoom feature. And another thing, why does he say Hindenburg before he dies. The Hindenburg was a rare event seen by a very few people. The zombie menace will been seen by everyone in the country, possibly the world. He doesnt think anyone else will get a few snapshots? They also managed to ruin the only semi-interesting scene in the film when the soldier is watching the exotic dancer. Why did the zombie hide behind a curtain for five minutes before attacking the girl? Especially when the zombie could have come through the DOOR. Its probably just something an unintelligent zombie movie fan such as myself wouldnt understand. Every day I pray that God with increase my brain capacity long enough for me to figure out all the subtle nuances in Feeding the Masses.Anywho, I think its interesting that this is the first movie that gave me the desire to physically hurt the people involved in the production. Hey Trent Haaga, Im calling you out!	movie
99	Bellamy under new fire\n\nNewcastle boss Graeme Souness has reopened his dispute with Craig Bellamy after claiming the Welshman was not good enough for the Magpies. Bellamy left Newcastle to join Celtic on loan after a major row with Souness. Souness - who refused to refer to the 25-year-old by name - said Bellamy did not score enough goals The chap thats just gone has scored 9.3 goals a season in his time in senior football - half of those werent even in the top flight, said Souness. Thats not good enough for a striker at a club like this. We need to have two strikers who are near 20 goals on a regular basis.\n\nBellamy turned down a move to Birmingham in favour of joining Celtic after a disagreement about the Welsh international playing out of position quickly escalated. Earlier in the week, Souness had said that he risked losing the confidence of the players and damaging his own reputation if he had not taken a hard line after Bellamy accused him of lying.\n\nThere are certain things you can forgive and forget, said Souness. But if Id been seen to be weak in this case there was no future for me with the players in the dressing room or any job I have after Newcastle. He could then return to St James Park - and he says that he wants to. However, it would seem unlikely he will play for Newcastle again as long as Souness remains in charge.\n	sport
100	Super Size Me wins writers award\n\nSuper Size Me director Morgan Spurlock has won the Writers Guild of Americas award for documentary feature writing.\n\nThe Oscar-nominated film followed Spurlock as he ate only McDonalds fast food for an entire month. Spurlock was given the award at a special ceremony at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood on Tuesday. Organisers said the rising popularity of documentary films led them to honour a writer for a documentary screenplay for the first time.\n\nProducer Brian Grazer presented the award to Spurlock and the films backers, Roadside Attractions, Samuel Goldwyn Films and Showtime Independent Films. Spurlock set out to discover the effect of living on nothing but McDonalds for a month, upgrading to supersize portions when offered. The film followed his 25lb weight gain and the health effects on his body, including his liver and cholesterol levels. McDonalds announced it was to scrap its supersized meals last year, but denied the move was as a result of the negative publicity created by Spurlocks film. Spurlock was given his award on the same day the European Court of Human Rights ruled that two UK activists should have been given legal aid in their long fight against a McDonalds libel action. Helen Steel and David Morris, from north London, dubbed the McLibel Two, were found guilty in a 1990s trial of libelling the company in a leaflet they had been handing out At the end of the case the High Court in London ruled McDonalds had been libelled and awarded the company £60,000 in damages, later reduced to £40,000 on appeal. But he found the leaflet was true in some aspects.\n	entertainment
101	I was 5 years old when I saw this musical movie while on vacation with my family in St. Thomas in 1977 and immediately fell in love with it. 27 years later, it is still an original inspiration for achieveing my goals that I have set to accomplish since that time!This tragic story of a hard-core behind the scenes of the entertainment industry during the late 50s, Sparkle successfully portrays the struggle of three young sisters looking for their place in the sun. This story could simply become the biographical story of many young aspiring artists about what could materialize when things seem to happen too fast and role models are not available to lend a helping hand.The phenomenal music written and composed by Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield, the soundtrack carries the plot with every song. From being subjected to situations that almost leave no choice for strong long-term decision-making, to making the ultimate sacrifice in order to get ahead, all three young girls, Sparkle, Sister, and Delores, represent the different routes that one could take when you set out to achieve your ideal opportunity as your contribution to society.This movie could have possibly spawned the ideas of creating Dreamgirls on Broadway, and Mariah Careys Glitter, 25 years later. As an original audience member of both productions, I have seen a lot of similarities in both stories to Sparkle, as well as in Saturday Night Fever, Fame, Flashdance, and the off-Broadway smash hit Mama, I Want To Sing.	movie

Newcomer Ciara - who recently beat Elvis Presley to the UK number one spot - has four nominations, while Alicia Keys has three. The Soul Train Awards ceremony will take place in Hollywood on 28 February.\n\nUsher has already swept the board at the American Music Awards with four titles, including two best album awards. His Soul Train nominations include best male R&B-soul album and best male R&B-soul single for Confessions Part II. Ushers work with rappers Ludacris & Lil Jon won him nominations for best R&B-soul or rap music video and best R&B-soul or rap dance cut for the song Yeah!, while his duet with Keys, My Boo, earned the pair a nod for best R&B-soul single. Keys album The Diary of Alicia Keys was also up for best R&B-soul album by a female. Her song If I Aint Got You received a best single nomination in the female R&B-soul category. Newcomer Ciaras four nominations include best female R&B-soul album and best R&B-soul or rap by a new artist. Beyonce, Prince, Destinys Child, Jill Scott and New Edition all received two nominations each. The Soul Train Music Awards, which started 18 years ago, celebrates artists in R&B, hip-hop, rap and gospel music.\n	entertainment
103	I kind of consider myself as the #1 fan of Hidden Frontier, seeing as I am among a somewhat small group of fans who have actually met most of these guys - well, not counting conventions, of course. I have been watching Hidden Frontier since 2001, and I must say I continue to be impressed by what these guys have come up with.Hidden Frontier is the brainchild of Rob Caves and his self-made studio, Areakt Pictures, which operates out of the back room of his house. While not as fancy as, say, the TOS-based series New Voyages (which sometimes gets some of the actors/writers from the original series, like Walter Koenig, aka Mr. Chekov), Rob and the cast and crew of HF manage to create a series worthy of replacing that ghastly experiment we called Enterprise. The most controversial and successful story arc has been the introduction of Star Treks first openly gay character, Corey Aster (who was introduced in the second season), and his search to find a soul mate. Somewhere later in the series, he meets Jorian Zen, the Excelsiors Trill helm officer. In the recent story lines with these two characters (WARNING: MAJOR SPOILER! Do not read if you have not watched the series up to this point!), Zen is joined to an exiled symbiont, causing a great deal of change and some conflict in his relationship with Aster. Though the future is uncertain - seeing as the most recent episode, Beachhead, was just shown to HF fans in the chat room last night - I think that this relationship will endure, but only time will tell.Gene Roddenberry created Star Trek with the intention that the story be more about his characters rather than flashy space battles. Rob Caves created Hidden Frontier for that same reason - and this is what has made this series as popular as it is. As the previous comment stated, I wish I could give it a rating higher than 10, but it will have to suffice. Although next season will be the last - keeping in the tradition of seven season shows started by Star Trek: The Next Generation - I am willing to bet that we will hear much about Hidden Frontier after that final episode.	movie

105	Peers debate Crown succession law\n\nPeers are debating proposals to change the rules governing the succession to the throne.\n\nLabour peer Lord Dubs Succession to the Crown Bill aims to end the right of male heirs to succeed to the crown even if they have an older sister. The private members bill would also abolish the ban on heirs to the throne marrying Roman Catholics. The Fabian Societys Sundar Katwala said the change was long overdue and that he expected a warm response. The political reform groups general secretary told BBC Radio 4s Today Programme there were some very out-dated features at the heart of Britains constitution.\n\nIn 1998 the government said in principle it supported the idea of ending gender discrimination and that it would consult on how to come forward with its own measures. We hope they are warm towards it and dont say this is the wrong time. He pointed out that it was 30 years since the sex discrimination act and urged politicians on all sides to back the bill. Mr Katwala added: This is long overdue. Parliament will have to do it eventually, the government, and I hope all of the political parties, might think this is a very simple thing to have in their manifestos.\n\nBut he acknowledged that even if the bill did win support, it was unlikely to become law because the legislative programme is likely to be squeezed by the coming general election. He said he hoped the bill would be a gentle nudge to the government and suggested it would demand a response. The bill, which is in the Lords for its second reading, has been adopted by former chief whip Ann Taylor in the Commons. The rule of succession is regulated not only through descent and tradition but also by the Act of Settlement which confirmed in 1701 that it was for Parliament to determine the title to the throne.\n	politics
106	Jobs go at Oracle after takeover\n\nOracle has announced it is cutting about 5,000 jobs following the completion of its $10.3bn takeover of its smaller rival Peoplesoft last week.\n\nThe company said it would retain more than 90% of Peoplesoft product development and product support staff. The cuts will affect about 9% of the 55,000 staff of the combined companies. Oracles 18-month fight to acquire Peoplesoft was one of the most drawn-out and hard-fought US takeover battles of recent times. The merged companies are set to be a major force in the enterprise software market, second only in size to Germanys SAP.\n\nIn a statement, Oracle said it began notifying staff of redundancies on Friday and the process would continue over the next 10 days. By retaining the vast majority of Peoplesoft technical staff, Oracle will have the resources to deliver on the development and support commitments we have made to Peoplesoft customers over the last 18 months, Oracles chief executive Larry Ellison said in a statement.\n\nCorrespondents say 6,000 job losses had been expected - and some suggest more cuts may be announced in future. They say Mr Ellison may be trying to placate Peoplesoft customers riled by Oracles determined takeover strategy. Hours before Fridays announcement, there was a funereal air at Peoplesofts headquarters, reported AP news agency. A Peoplesoft sign had been turned into shrine to the company, with flowers, candles and company memorabilia. Were mourning the passing of a great company, the agency quoted Peoplesoft worker David Ogden as saying. Other employees said they would rather be sacked than work for Oracle. The new company is going to be totally different, said Anil Aggarwal, Peoplesofts director of database markets. Peoplesoft had an easygoing, relaxed atmosphere. Oracle has an edgy, aggressive atmosphere thats not conducive to innovative production. On the news, Oracle shares rose 15 cents - 1.1% - on Nasdaq. In after-hours trading the shares did not move.\n	business
107	Ukraine strikes Turkmen gas deal\n\nUkraine has agreed to pay 30% more for natural gas supplied by Turkmenistan.\n\nThe deal was sealed three days after Turkmenistan cut off gas supplies in a price dispute that threatened the Ukrainian economy. Supplies from Turkmenistan account for 45% of all natural gas imported by Ukraine, which has large coal deposits but no gas fields. Turkmenistan is also trying to strike a similar deal with Russia, which is not so dependent on its gas. Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov, who signed the contract, said the Turkmen side agreed to lower the price demanded by $2 per 1,000 cubic metres, bringing it down to $58. But the new price is still $14 higher than the price fixed in the contract for 2004. The head of the Ukrainian state-owned Naftohaz company, Yury Boyko, said he was fully happy with the deal. On Friday, Turkmenistan acted on a threat and shut off gas supplies to Ukraine in attempt to bring the price dispute to a head. Mr Niyazov said that his government would insist on the same price for supplies to Russia. Analysts say thay may not happen as Russia, the worlds leading gas producer, needs the cheap Turkmen gas only to relieve is state-owned Gazprom from costly investment in the exploration of oil fields in Siberia. Turkmenistan is the second-largest gas producer in the world.\n	business

Before I wrap this up, Id like to say that the performances were top grade, the direction was flawless, the production design was nice, the casting was perfect, and the costumes were perfectly designed. In conclusion, to anyone whos a fan of Jason Lee or Julia Stiles, I recommend this movie. Youre in for lots of laughs and thrills, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.	movie
109	Kannathil Muthamittal is for sure a great movie. I have to give it to Mani Ratnam for a great directing job and A.R. Rahman for great songs. The camera work is just excellent and is similar to Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan. I will be shocked if this movie does not win an Oscar for Best Foreign Film or even Best Camera Work.	movie

111	This show has been performed live around the country with a wide variety of casts. I saw it first in the Provincetown production the first summer it was in P-town (2001)--before it was, curiously enough, banned in that overwhelmingly gay resort (the codes which resulted in its closing have since been amended). I saw it again later in the off-Broadway, long-running production in New York. Oddly enough, the P-town production was far better than the New York one--fresher, cuter, more spirited and funnier--but that was only in the 2001 showing; subsequent attempts to clone the production (Bare Naked Lads in 2007) were definitely third-rate. This filmed production features a Los Angelos production cast, and it is, as other comments have suggested, not the best. I would rate it somewhere in between the top-notch 2001 P-town production and the third-rate Bare Naked Lads P-town show from last summer.	movie
112	This is an interesting left turn for Reel 13 Indies. TWO HARBORS is a B&W 75 minute film from Minnesota that features non-actors and is about two people finding a connection through a search for alien life. I applaud the boldness of the Reel 13 programmers of thinking out-of-the-box when selecting this film. I just wish they had picked a stronger film to be bold with. As a matter of fact, I wonder if the choice had more to do with the uniqueness of the film than with the actual quality of the film itself (Not that TWO HARBORS is completely without merit, but Ill get to that a little later). As is common with independent films, TWO HARBORS is limited in terms of location. There are only two real locations  a large junk dealership market and a very teeny trailer, which is the home of the middle-aged main character, Vic, played by Alex Cole. Writer/director James Vculek uses the market setting to provide exposition about Vic, who is one of the dealers there. He has various people walk up to Vic and start very long conversations that provides us with just two pieces of information  Vic sells space toys (he prefers to call them outer space action figures) and he is a caustic asshole. This is emblematic of one of the two key problems with TWO HARBORS - all the chatting. Ive said it before and Ill say it again  we are dealing with a visual medium and filmmakers need to work harder to tell their stories visually. There are exceptions, of course, but generally, endless patter is not so engaging on film  particularly if the dialogue is being used as exposition. Pretty much all the conversations in the film are long and unnecessarily verbose. A notable example would be a few scenes which feature Vic trying to play himself off as a Boy Scout leader in order to get a discount at a store. He argues with the clerk back and forth and these scenes dont even advance the plot one iota. This is the kind of thing that makes even a 75 minute film feel long.The other problem with TWO HARBORS is the acting. I may be a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to performance in film, but I really dont feel like theres a good excuse for not having good actors in your films. There are plenty of good actors out there, many of which willing to work on low-budget projects  even in Minnesota. Many filmmakers eschew the importance of acting ability as being secondary to their visuals, but that is naïve. In narrative film-making, next to the story, nothing is more important than the acting/performances. If you dont believe the people enacting your story, your audience is lost.Originally, I thought Vculek was using non-actors, but as the film went on, I decided that they were probably community theater-type actors. It wasnt that they were uncomfortable on camera. Its that they were overly theatrical (i.e. big). Granted, the best of the actors were the two leads  Cole and Catherine E. Johnson as Cassie, a lonely young girl that gets caught up in Vics extra-terrestrial hunt. They seemed to have the most training, but they were still a little rough around the edges. The eccentricities they displayed seemed to be surface only - not coming from a real, organic place within. Ms. Johnson, in particular, is an interesting case. She definitely has a presence  a Midwestern charm about her, but that charisma belies the multitude of issues her character is supposed to have. She struggles to portray the idiosyncrasies that stem from a supposed life of solitude and (slave?) labor, relying on stock gestures like eye rolls, lip biting and stammering to suggest her discomfort with the outside world.I mentioned in the first paragraph that TWO HARBORS is not completely without merit and heres what I mean. Without giving too much away, there is a fade to white an hour into the film. After that, the story takes a stunning turn, which allows the last fifteen minutes to be evocative and downright powerful  its like a sucker punch to the gut, but in a good way. Its almost a huge relief to feel something after so long with these characters. The last five minutes of the film dont have any dialogue at all and the result is the best part of the film  subtle, detailed (Cole does his best work of the film) and most importantly, cinematic. Then, with the closing credits comes the most staggering revelation of all  that its based on a true story, which got me to thinking. With all the dialogue, the minimal locations and the lack of cinematic qualities, it occurred to me that with two kick ass actors and a tightening re-write, TWO HARBORS might make a really kick-ass stage play  maybe even a one-act. If there are any bold theater producers out there reading this, I definitely recommend seeing if you can get a hold of the film and contact the filmmaker, Reel 13 or whomever. There might be something to this story after all(For more information on this or any other Reel 13 film, check out their website at www.reel13.org)	movie
113	Franz man seeks government help\n\nFranz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos has called for more government help for musicians, while taking part in an Edinburgh Lectures discussion.\n\nFor any cultural output to thrive there needs to be some kind of state input to that as well, he said. But Kapranos warned against musicians being too closely linked with MPs, at the University of Edinburgh event. I think the role of musicians is to question politicians rather than to go to bed with them, he said.\n\nKapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss Scotlands role in making 21st Century music. There are elements of our musical output which require sustenance because they arent self-sufficient, he said. But so-called commercial music would benefit from investment as well. He warned musicians against being allied to a particular party, however. I dont know if having tea with politicians is always a good idea.\n\nKapranos and his Glasgow four-piece band have been nominated for five prizes at next weeks Brit Awards, including best group and best album. Their self-titled debut album won last years Mercury Music Prize and spawned three top 20 singles. He told the 300-strong audience at the Universitys Reid Hall that musicians should listen to a wide range of music and should not be restricted by stereotypes. We say I like this. Because I listen to Nirvana and Korn I am a troubled individual, Im riddled with angst because I listen to Chopin and Debussy, I listen to Kylie Minogue and Scissor Sisters because Im upbeat and I like to party, I listen to Wagner because I like the smell of napalm in the morning. Kapranos said there was a general hostility towards classical music, adding: There is very little done to break that hostility other than Classic FM.\n\nHe concluded: We define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity. Fellow speaker and classical composer James MacMillan agreed: We need to rediscover our ability to listen. Previous speakers at the Edinburgh Lectures series have included former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and author Professor Stephen Hawking. Kapranos described his appearance on Wednesday as more daunting by a long way than their upcoming Brits performance. I dont really care about the Brits, he said. Its going to be great to go down but I have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonight.\n\nI think the government should do more to help up-and-coming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues. Also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels.\n\nRather than expecting the government - i.e. the taxpayer - to fork out, why dont some of the megastars put something back in? Some of Britains wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums, concerts etc. There are far more important demands on government funds.\n\nIf they can fund football, why not fund music?\n\nAreas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants, so why not music? We already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music. The only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash.\n\nThe government has enough problems funding schools and health services. If Alex Kapranos genuinely thinks a multi-billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that.\n\nAs a Scot living in England, I appreciate the value of Scottish music and culture being a success, so I can see no problem with it! Franz Ferdinand, Travis and Snow Patrol are just recent examples of the success Scottish music can have in the world, so we should do what we Scots are good at and support our own goods!\n\nI think the issue is more fundamental: should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi-million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state? The answer is most definitely no. Those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldnt be looking for government subsidies. I know that if I was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping I would want to finance myself until I was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship.\n\nYes the government should fund music - it brings joy to the masses.\n\nThere are already thousands of state-funded musicians out there sitting around, twiddling their thumbs on the new deal. Getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use.\n\nAs long as the Government was funding real talent it would be a great move. I would hate to see more Pop Idol-type funding of music though, as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that Alex talked about.\n\nOnly if the proposals make financial sense. Franz Ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales - if theyd had a government grant to get started theyd have more than paid it back by now, so the Treasury would be making far more than it paid out. However, the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides theyre a musician. The government shouldnt fund music - it should invest in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment.\n\nI think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise. The equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people. However, I do feel this should be the extent of their role, to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there.\n\nI do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies! They generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately, the directors are in the business for! If labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldnt have to fork out a great deal.\n\nYeah, why not? Music should be government funded, particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands/artists and stuff. Pop music pretty much rules the earth, so more attention should go to the other fraternities\n\nI agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but I am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer. There is a great deal of money generated through pop music - perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy. Perhaps we could financially penalise really bad Pop Idol-style music - that is, the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers. Call it a tax on music pollution, if you like.\n\nThough I really like Franz Ferdinand, I have to disagree with Mr Kapranos. Once government gets their hand into the private sector, it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues. Many years ago, this was the case with the US NEA, when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting. The solution Mr Kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations, like Save the Music in the US.\n	entertainment

118	Note: This should probably be read only after watching the film.It is very rare to find a documentary or movie that focuses on the loser. Deep Water does just this, making it one of the most thought provoking films in a very long time. It does not provide us with a hero to look up to, but rather an anti-hero who forces us to look into ourselves.The film is about a group of men who attempt to sail around the globe, singlehandedly, and without stopping. Only one makes it, several die, one decides not to return home, each of them on a psychological journey intriguing enough to merit entire films for themselves. Yet the most interesting is Donald Crowhurst, or rather the way that he is portrayed by the filmmakers and our reactions to him as viewers.By any standards this man should be considered a despicable character, yet why is he depicted so heroically? Why are we so sympathetic to him? From the beginning he made all of the wrong choices. He risked his family financially to get the boat, he left at a more dangerous time to get more publicity, he ignored all of the warnings despite his lack of experience, he chose to lie instead of admitting defeat, these choices snowball until the inevitable and final one: suicide. All for what? A place in history? A feeling of accomplishment? Perhaps. What is important to consider is whether this mans situation was inevitable.Each individual must ask himself if his natural human drive for fame and accomplishment would bring him to such recklessness, and I believe that examining your own reaction to Crowhursts story will offer at least some answer to that question.	movie
119	This is one of the better Marion Davies talkies - and one of the few to allow her to exhibit her skill as a physical comedian which was so endearing in her silent films. OK, so she does a clunky tap number, but even Ruby Keelers dancing from the era does not hold up for younger generations. The problem here is the script. The story falls into unbelievable melodrama in the last reel. Its quite stagey, and is obviously adapted from a play... but not well enough. Still, there is some snappy dialogue and slapstick throughout. Worth a look.	movie

123	BP surges ahead on high oil price\n\nOil giant BP has announced a 26% rise in annual profits to $16.2bn (£8.7bn) on the back of record oil prices.\n\nLast week, rival Shell reported an annual profit of $17.5bn - a record profit for a UK-listed company. BP added that it was increasing its fourth-quarter dividend by 26% to 8.5 cents, and that it would continue with share buybacks. BP chief executive Lord Browne said the results were strong both operationally and financially.\n\nThe company is earning about $1.8m an hour.\n\nDespite the record annual profits figure, BPs performance was below the expectations of some City analysts. However, BPs share price rose 4p or nearly 1% in morning trading to 548p. Its profit rise for the year included profits of $3.65bn (£1.97bn) for the final three months of 2004 - up from $2.89bn a year ago but below its third quarter.\n\nSpeaking on the BBCs Today programme on Tuesday, Lord Browne said the profits were not solely down to the high oil price alone.\n\nThe profits are up more than the price of oil is up, he said. Lord Browne pointed out that BP was reaping the benefits of its investment in oil exploration. We have spent many years buying (assets) when the price is low, he said. The company has made new discoveries in Egypt, the Gulf of Mexico and Angola.\n\nHowever, Lord Browne rejected calls for a windfall tax on his companys huge profits, saying that in the North Sea it paid progressively more tax, the more profits it made. Lord Browne believes oil prices will remain quite high. Currently above $40 a barrel, he said: The price of oil will be well supported above $30 a barrel for the medium term. BP put production for the year at 3.997 billion barrels of oil, up 10% on 2003, but slightly lower than the four billion barrels it had initially aimed for.\n	business
124	Format wars could confuse users\n\nTechnology firms Sony, Philips, Matsushita and Samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video.\n\nThe firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. The move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different, and conflicting, content control systems, experts warned. They say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy.\n\nCurrently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. Systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as Digital Rights Management systems. By setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. In a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content. The firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought. Called the Marlin Joint Development Association, the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. Marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm Intertrust as well as an earlier DRM system developed by a group known as the Coral Consortium.\n\nThe move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by Apple and Microsoft. Confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as Microsoft and Apple. In many ways the different DRM systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as Betamax and VHS, that consumers have seen in the past, said Ian Fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at Jupiter Research. The difference is that it is very fragmented, he said. Its not a two-horse race, its a five, six, seven or even eight-horse race Mr Fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. He said currently there were even incompatibilities within DRM families. Although initiatives such as Microsofts Plays for Sure program could help remove some of the uncertainty, he said, life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come.\n\nShelley Taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. Apples iTunes service was a perfect example of this, she said. Although iTunes has been hugely successful, Apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those iPods, she said.\n\nShe said rampant competition between online music services, of which there are now 230 according to recent figures, could drive more openness and freer file formats. It always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run, she said, and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest. Ms Taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop. People want portability, she said, and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability. Cory Doctorow, European co-ordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues, expressed doubts that the Marlin system would achieve its aims. Not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying, he said. He said many firms readily admit that their DRM systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. Instead, said Mr Doctorow, DRM systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers. The studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the iPod version, the auto version, the American and UK version, the ringtone version, and so on.\n	tech

126	Three DJs replace Peel radio show\n\nThe late John Peels BBC Radio 1 show is to be succeeded in February by three shows hosted by three DJs focusing on diverse, non-commercial music.\n\nHuw Stephens, Ras Kwame and Rob Da Bank will each host the mid-week, late-night timeslot, showcasing UK talent. Radio 1 said the show would not try to replace Peel, but would rise to the challenge of keeping his legacy alive with unpredictable music. Peel died after suffering a heart attack in Peru in October. Radio 1 said the three DJs had been chosen for their in-depth musical knowledge across a variety of musical genres. Rob Da Bank has been hosting The John Peel Show since the DJs death. He is also one of the hosts of The Blue Room, an early morning weekend show that plays a mix of old and new electronic and dance music. Huw Stephens is currently one half of the Radio 1 Thursday night show Bethan and Huw in Wales, which explores new music, especially up and coming acts breaking through in Wales. And Ras Kwame is the host of 100% Homegrown on Radio 1s digital station 1Xtra. His show is dedicated to showcasing the best of UK black music and broadcasts live sessions, often giving new artists their first chance to perform on live national radio.\n\nAll of the three DJs will continue to host their current shows on Radio 1. It is widely accepted that John Peel can never be replaced, said the radio station. It added that One Music would support both signed and unsigned talent, and said: It will seek out those making music for musics sake rather than for commercial success. Above all it will provide support to emerging genres of music and styles that have not yet and may never reach the mainstream.\n\nOne Music is not new to Radio 1 as it already exists as a website, offering advice on aspects of the music industry, such as recording a demo and signing a record contract. Radio 1s controller, Andy Parfitt, said: We believe that by having a series of DJs hosting a selection of shows under the One Music title, we will ensure that his legacy lives on. Stephens said he grew up listening to John and that it was a massive honour to continue Peels work championing new music. The show will be broadcast from 1 February on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2300 GMT - 0100 GMT.\n	entertainment
127	After Garbos introduction to sound in Clarence Browns Anna Christie, Jacques Feyder made a German version of the movie where all of the cast, except for Garbo, were different. While the American version is still more available in the USA and most of the American viewers have primarily seen this version, the Germna Anna Christie is more likely to be viewed in Europe. As I have seen both films, I feel the right to compare the two closely-knit productions. Is Jacques Feyders film different? Is it better than Clarence Browns? In this analysis, I would like to focus first on what the both movies have in common. They have identical sets, very similar scripts and the same chronologically presented scenes. Here, you also find the story of the young woman who comes back to her father after years of absence and is trying to start a new life. Here, you also have the humorous, though a bit shorter, sequence in the amusement park. However, when emphasizing Garbo herself, I address the first difference. She does not appear to cause such a curiosity while talking. The viewer concentrates more on her acting than on the way she speaks, which occurred, most probably, to 1931 viewers. Garbo was very good in American film and she is also very good here. Yet, to me, she seems even more genuine in the German version. It is noticeable that Garbo does not focus on the way she says the words that much (the effort that was artificially created by the sensation: GARBO TALKS!). Her German is not very well pronounced; yet no one cares: everything is perfectly understood. Therefore, I can easily say the same I did in my American version comment: Skaal Greta Garbo! Yet, the film differs in one very important issue: the rest of the cast. Here comes the question: which portrayal seems more captivating, which one is better for sure? The differences are filled with varieties. Salka Viertel (or Salka Steuerman), Garbos lifelong friend, does not do the equally great job as Marie Dressler in the role of Marthy Owens. She is not bad, she is different, sometimes overacts (from todays perspective) but is no longer that genuine in the role as Marie Dressler who still amuses us and whose moments have absolutely stood a test of time. Some people even claim that Dressler was better than Garbo in the film and that opinion, though appears to be questionable of course, carries some truth. Theo Shall is more sympathetic as Matt than Charles Bickford but when applied to him, this is not the matter of performance so much as the mater of looks.Who shines in the German Anna Christie, who is really worth greatest attention is Hans Junkermann in the role of Chris Christopherson, Annas father. George F. Marion vs Hans Junkermann is like a day vs night difference. Junkermann portrays a real alcohol addict, a man with hopes, with fears, who overdoes the care of his daughter. The scene of Annas first meeting with her father is truly magnificent, the opening moment of Chris conversation with Marthy is memorable particularly thanks to his facial expressions and a flawless performance. Junkermann is the Chris whom you like, who you sometimes laugh at, whom you sympathize with, who leaves a picture of a calm alcoholic sailor in your mind. Great! If you have seen the American Anna Christie and have a chance to get the German version, I would highly recommend to you this movie because its a slightly different look at the story, a nice and accurate way to compare, a fine enrichment to Clarence Browns movie and, foremost, a wonderful chance to discover a marvel of performance: Hans Junkermanns. Skaal or Prost, Hans Junkermann!	movie

129	Pupils to get anti-piracy lessons\n\nLessons on music piracy and copyright issues are to be taught to secondary school pupils in the UK.\n\nThe lessons, aimed at 11 to 14-year-olds, will introduce them to copyright - including the issues of downloading from the internet and the illegal copying of CDs - and its role in protecting creativity.\n\nMusic piracy, including illegally swapping music online, costs the UK music industry millions every year and has been blamed for a decline in world-wide CD sales. British Music Rights (BMR) - which was formed to represent the interests of songwriters and composers - worked with education experts to put together a learning pack.\n\nSongwriter Guy Chambers, who has worked with stars including Robbie Williams, has thrown his support behind the scheme. He said as well as educating children about music piracy, it would also protect young people planning a career in the music industry from unscrupulous individuals. At a debate in London to launch the scheme, Chambers said: I think it is important that young people receive practical and engaging learning in schools. These lessons will give them an insight into how the creative industries work which will help them in possible future careers. The education pack, which has already been requested by more than 1,600 secondary schools, is aimed at giving children an understanding of copyright in relation to the music industry. It will also teach children about the importance of royalties and raises awareness of different careers in the music industry, particularly in the digital age.\n\nHenri Yoxall, general manager of British Music Rights, told BBC News schools had been crying out for a resource to help them educate pupils about the issues. The scheme - which is an extension of BMRs Respect the Value of Music campaign - is also being backed by singer-songwriters Feargal Sharkey, Lucie Silvas and Grammy Award-winning composer David Arnold. Silvas said: I think it is so important that students gain an understanding of how the music industry works when they are at a young age. I wish I had been given an opportunity like this when I was at school. Emma Pike, director general of British Music Rights, said: We believe that copyright is an essential part of teaching music in schools. It is vital that the creatives of the future know how to turn their ideas into value. Copyright education has always been important... creatives are facing more challenges and more opportunities from technological change. Technology is allowing people to create music and distribute their music to the public in a whole host of new ways.\n	entertainment

133	Hard to imagine this film is based on a true story, and how Christy managed to accomplish the miracle is so heart-stirring. Daniel Day-Lewis is a chameleon, really hard to imagine how much effort he had done to create this disabled character. Watching him on screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience.The movie is not so pessimistic as I thought before, the story is kinda bright and intriguing. Christy is not despised by the normals, his life is also colorful and delightful, although we can be aware of the loneliness and the painful fetter through his eyes.One important factor of Christys success is his mothers support which seems to be more touching, and the unknown actress Brenda Fricker also deserves her Oscar award for this role, this fat little middle-aged woman uses her all to make Christys dream come true. So lucky for Christy!And Hugh OConor is also excellent as young Christy, what a performance for a child! The love story of Christy is very well-done, trustful. Christy wants love and nothing can derive him of the right to love, his crush on the beautiful Dr. Eileen Cole (surprisingly played by Fiona Shaw, I am deeply impressed with her role in Harry Potter series, the loathsome Aunt Petunia, so her appearance in this role is really beyond my mind, but anyway, any woman has her own youth...) is paranoiac and offensive, I do have sympathy for him, love is a two-edged sword, happiness and agony are just next to each other.Btw, Jim Sheridans works are all good (IN America, THE BOXER etc.) except GET RICH OR DIE Trying, god knows why he chose to direct that crap! Really a career taint for him, what a pity!	movie

If you watched 5 minutes of the actual show instead of watching the commercial you would have seen one of the greatest television shows in Canadian history being made. Too bad you would have been watching it alone. Probably the reason you hate it... no game. Keys to the VIP is hilarious, light and funny. Guys are going to eat this show up. My game is tight and I can hardly wait to get on this show. The chicks were HOOOOOT and the clubs kicked ass. Ill be watching every week. It makes me wonder why more great shows like this one arent being made. Now its clear that the talent in Canada has the ability to produce American quality television.	movie
135	Huge rush for Jet Airways shares\n\nIndian airline Jet Airways initial public offering was oversubscribed 16.2 times, bankers said on Friday.\n\nOver 85% of the bids were at the higher end of the price range of 1,050-1,125 rupees ($24-$26). Jet Airways, a low-fare airline, was founded by London-based ex-travel agent Naresh Goya, and controls 45% of the Indian domestic airline market. It sold 20% of its equity or 17.2 million shares in a bid to raise up to $443m (£230.8m). The price at which its shares will begin trading will be agreed over the weekend, bankers said. The demand for the IPO was impressive. We believe that over the next two years, the domestic aviation sector promises strong growth, even though fuel prices could be high, said Hiten Mehta, manager of merchant banking firm, Fortune Financial Services. India began to open up its domestic airline market - previously dominated by state-run carrier Indian Airlines - in the 1990s. Jet began flying in 1993 and now has competitors including Air Deccan and Air Sahara. Budget carriers Kingfisher Airlines and SpiceJet are planning to launch operations in May this year. Jet has 42 aircraft and runs 271 scheduled flights daily within India. It recently won government permission to fly to London, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.\n	business
182	Went to see this finnish film and Ive got to say that it is one of the better films Ive seen this year. The intrigue is made up of 5-6 different stories, all taking place the very same day in a small finnish town. The stories come together very nicely in the end, reminding, perhaps, a bit of the way Tarantinos movies are made. Most of the actors performed very well, which most certainly is needed in realistic dramas of this type. I especially enjoyed the acting by Sanna Hietala, the lead actress, and Juha Kukkonen. I noticed btw that IMDB has got the wrong information about Sanna. Her name, as you might have noticed in my review ;), is NOT Heikkilä, but Hietala.	movie

136	Edu blasts Arsenal\n\nArsenals Brazilian midfielder Edu has hit out at the club for stalling over offering him a new contract.\n\nEdus deal expires next summer and he has been linked with Spanish trio Real Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia. He told BBC Sport: Im not sure if I want to stay or not because the club have let the situation go on this far. If they had really wanted to sign they should have come up with an offer six months before indicating they wanted to sign me and thats made me think. Edus brother and representative Amadeo Fensao has previously said that Arsenals current offer to the midfielder was well short of what he was seeking. And Edu, 26, added: My brother is due to come to London on Thursday.\n\nThere is a meeting planned for 6 or 7 January to sort it out with Arsenal. Now I have a choice to stay or go. I want to sort it out as soon as possible, thats in the best interests of both the club and myself. Im going to make my decision after the meeting later this week. Edu is now able to begin negotiations with other clubs because Fifa regulations allow players to start talks six months before their contracts expire. The midfielder, who broke in to the Brazilian national side in 2004, admitted he had been flattered to have been linked with the three Spanish giants. Edu said: Ive just heard stories from the news that the Madrid president Florentino Perez, the Valencia people, as well as Barcelona are interested.\n\nThats nice, but Ive never talked to them, so I cant say they want me sign 100%. Last month Wenger said he we was hopeful Edu would sign a new deal and played down suggestions that the lure of a club like Real Madrid would be too strong for Edu. Edu added that he had been encouraged by Wengers support for him. I still have a good relationship with Arsene Wenger - hes always said he wants me to sign.\n	sport

140	Consumer concern over RFID tags\n\nConsumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency ID (RFID) tags in shops, a survey says.\n\nMore than half of 2,000 people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags, which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses. Some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases. The survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in Europe was low. The survey of consumers in the UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands was carried out by consultancy group Capgemini. The firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of RFID technology. The tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner - each item contains a unique identification number.\n\nMore than half (55%) of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that RFID tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases. Fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that RFID tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties. Ard Jan Vetham, Capgeminis principal consultant on RFID, said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about RFID before it would become accepted technology. Acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns. With the right RFID approach and ongoing communication with consumers, the industry can reach this point. He said that the survey also showed people would accept RFID if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items. The tags are currently being used at one Tesco distribution centre in the UK - the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items. They are also in use as a passcard for the M6 Toll in the Midlands, in the UK. Mr Vetham said the majority of people surveyed (52%) believed that RFID tags could be read from a distance. He said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology. At least once consumer group - Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering (Caspian) - has claimed that RFID chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing. All kinds of personal belongings, including clothes, could constantly broadcast messages about their whereabouts and their owners, it warned.\n	tech

142	We have all been asking ourselves why dont they remake the slasher films that were only OK instead of remaking the ones that were great already, that way they can only make it better? well with Prom Night they have remade the average but trashy fun 80s Jamie Lee Curtis film and made it even WORSE. Its a paint by numbers slasher film which is clearly trying to attract the young teens (hence no violence etc), the knife in this slasher flick is blunt.The director spends so much time focusing on trying to make the rather attractive killer look somewhat creepy that anything else goes out of the window.The cast who include Britney Snow (who was superb in Hairspray) try their hardest but the material gives them nothing to do but pout and look scared.More annoying is how the death scenes are handled (we will hear the attack but wont see it). It also looks like the only place the knife in this film worked was in the editing suite since the film looks like it has been butchered (im guessing anything remotely scary ended up on the cutting room floor so as not to scare the kids) Yet in pours the money from Americans sending this film to number 1 at the box office!!! Slasher movies are a lot of fun but in Prom Nights case it made me want to download the original.Ive seen scarier OC and Dawsons Creek episodes	movie

150	Google shares fall as staff sell\n\nShares in Google have fallen 6.7% after employees and early investors in the web search took advantage of the first chance to sell their holdings.\n\nRestrictions were imposed ahead of its flotation in August, to prevent shares being dumped quickly onto the market. In one of the most closely-watched initial public offerings in stock market history, the US-based company sold 19.6 million shares at $85 each. Google shares have risen since but fell $12.33 on Tuesday to close at $172.55. The restriction - known as a lockup - is being eased piecemeal: in all, some 227 million additional shares will become free to trade by February 2005. Selling the shares could turn many of Googles workers into millionaires.\n\nThere were fears that the potential increase of shares in circulation from Tuesday would ease demand for stock. However, analysts say they expected most shareholders would be holding back from selling all their shares immediately, as Googles good performance and future growth potential means demand will hold.\n\nIn its first earnings report since floating on the stock market, Google said it made a net profit of $52m in the three months ending 30 September. Sales surged to $805.9m in the third quarter, up from $393.9m a year earlier. Googles main service - its internet search - is free to users, so the firm makes much of its money from selling advertising space linked to the words for which its users search. It also sells the use of its technology to companies who need to make either their websites, or their internal information systems, searchable.\n	business

152	Carry On star Patsy Rowlands dies\n\nActress Patsy Rowlands, known to millions for her roles in the Carry On films, has died at the age of 71.\n\nRowlands starred in nine of the popular Carry On films, alongside fellow regulars Sid James, Kenneth Williams and Barbara Windsor. She also carved out a successful television career, appearing for many years in ITVs well-loved comedy Bless This House. Rowlands died in Hove on Saturday morning, her agent said.\n\nBorn in January 1934, Rowlands won a scholarship to the Guildhall School of Speech and Drama scholarship when she was just 15.\n\nAfter spending several years at the Players Theatre in London, she made her film debut in 1963 in Tom Jones, directed by Tony Richardson. She made her first Carry On film in 1969 where she appeared in Carry On Again Doctor. Rowlands played the hard-done-by wife or the put-upon employee as a regular Carry On star. She also appeared in Carry On at your Convenience, Carry On Matron and Carry On Loving, as well as others.\n\nIn recent years she appeared in BBC mini-series The Cazalets and played Mrs Potts in the London stage version of Beauty and the Beast. Agent Simon Beresford said: She was just an absolutely favourite client She never complained about anything, particularly when she was ill, she was an old trouper. She was of the old school - she had skills from musical theatre and high drama, that is why she worked with the great and the good of directors. She didnt mind always being recognised for the Carry On films because she thoroughly enjoyed making them. She was a really lovely person and she will be much missed. Her last appearance on stage was as Mrs Pearce in the award-winning production of My Fair Lady at the National Theatre. Previously married, she leaves one son, Alan. Her funeral will be a private, family occasion, with a memorial service at a later date.\n	entertainment

154	Film critics of the world, I apologize. It is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on. But I ignored your advice and I have been deeply hurt. However, my decision to see The Cat in the Hat wasnt made haphazardly. You see, three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the calamity known as How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful, funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat. So when the critics unleashed their fury against The Cat in the Hat, another big budget Seuss update with a big name star in the title role, I thought that it must be the same old song. How wrong I was.For five whole minutes I thought I was in the clear. The opening credits are clever, the kids are charming and the production values are top notch. Then the cat showed up. There are many problems from this point on, but the biggest one was the woeful miscasting of Mike Myers. Where The Grinch was saved by the inspired casting of Jim Carrey, The Cat was destroyed by Myers. He can be very funny when his energies are applied where they belong, comic sketches. Every movie hes made that was truly funny was really just a feature length comedy sketch, from Waynes World to Austin Powers. So he tries to do the same thing here, its just that these comedy sketches are more like the stuff that they stick at the end of SNL, not funny, just painful. Not that the writers helped him out any. After the charming prologue the movie turns into an hour of repulsive bodily humor gags, poorly timed pratfalls and insultingly stunted attempts at hip humor. This movie was the most disheartening cinematic experience I have ever had. Period. So much talent and work went into something so vile. I know that the adult stars of this movie will be relatively unscathed by this mess, I just hope that the wonderful Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning will get more chances to show their charms in far better movies. If you are a parent, please avoid this like the plague. With movies like Elf and Brother Bear currently in theaters, you have far better choices.	movie

157	When George C. Scott played the title role in Patton, you saw him directing tanks with pumps of his fist, shooting at German dive bombers with a revolver, and spewing profanity at superiors and subordinates alike. The most action we get from Gregory Peck as MacArthur, a figure from the same war of debatably greater accomplishment, is when he taps mapboards with his finger and raises that famous eyebrow of his.Comparing Pecks performance with Scotts may be unfair. Yet the fact MacArthur was made by the same producer and scored by the same composer begs parallels, as does the fact both films open with the generals addressing cadets at West Point. Its clear to me the filmmakers were looking to mimic that Oscar-winning film of a few years before. But while Peck looks the part more than Scott ever did, he comes off as mostly bland in a story that feels less like drama than a Wikipedia walkthrough of MacArthurs later career.To this day there are those who think he was a dangerous demagogue and others who say he was one of the greatest men who ever lived, an opening title crawl tells us. Its a typical dishwater bit of post-Vietnam sophistry about those who led Americas military, very much of its time, but what we get here is neither view. MacArthur as presented here doesnt anger or inspire the way he did in life.Director Joseph Sargent, who went on to helm the famous turkey Jaws The Revenge, does a paint-by-numbers job with bland battle montages and some obvious set use (as when the Chinese attack U.S. forces in Korea), while the script by Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins trots out a MacArthur who comes across as good-natured to the point of blandness, a bit too caught up in his public image, but never less than decent.Here you see him stepping off the landing craft making his return to the Phillipines. There you see him addressing Congress in his Old Soldiers Never Die speech. For a long stretch of time he sits in a movie theater in Toyko, waiting for the North Koreans to cross the 38th parallel so we can get on with the story while newsreel footage details Japans rise from the ashes under his enlightened rule. Pecks co-actors, Marj Dusay as his devoted wife (youre my finest soldier) and Nicolas Coaster as a loyal aide, burnish teary eyes in the direction of their companions magnificence but garner no interest on their own.Even when he argues with others, Peck never raises his voice and for the most part wins his arguments with thunderous eloquence. When Admiral Nimitz suggests delaying the recapture of the Philippines, a point of personal pride as well as tactical concern for MacArthur, MacArthur comes back with the comment: Just now, as I listened to his plan, I thought I saw our flag going down. Doubtless the real Nimitz would have had something to say about that, but the character in the movie just bows his head and meekly accepts the insult in the presence of President Roosevelt.The only person in the movie who MacArthur seriously disagrees with is Harry S Truman, who Ed Flanders does a fine job with despite a prosthetic nose that makes him resemble Toucan Sam. Trumans firing of MacArthur should be a dramatic high point, but here it takes place in a quiet dinner conversation, in which Peck plays MacArthur as nothing less than a genial martyr.Ive never been sold by Pecks standing at the upper pantheon of screen stars; he delivers great presence but lacks complexity even in many of his best-known roles. But its unfair to dock him so much here, as he gets little help defining MacArthur as anything other than a speechifying bore. Except for two scenes, one where he rails against the surrender of the Philippines (He struck Old Glory and ran up a bedsheet!) and another where he has a mini-breakdown while awaiting the U.S. invasion of Inchon, inveighing against Communists undermining him at the White House, Peck really plays Peck here, not the complex character who inspired the famous sobriquet American Caesar. The real MacArthur might have been worthy of such a comparison. What you get here is less worthy of Shakespeare than Shakes the Clown.	movie
158	Seriously, I can easily stomach a lot of on screen blood, gore and repulsiveness, but what really makes this film disturbing & uncomfortable to watch is how the doctor character keeps on rambling about the physical damage done to raped women. He, John Cassavetes of Rosemarys Baby, talks about ruptured uterus, dry intercourse and massive loads of reddish (?) sperm like they are the most common little ailments in the world of medicine. That being said, Incubus is an ultimately STRANGE horror effort. It isnt necessarily awful  although it isnt very good, neither  but just plain weird. The muddled & incoherent script initially revolves on the hunt for a rapist-killer of flesh and blood (even though the title clearly suggests the involvement of a supernatural creature) and it never seems to stop introducing new characters. None of these characters, especially not the main ones, come across as sympathetic and for some never-explained reason they all seem to keep dark secrets. The aforementioned doctor has an odd interpretation of daughter-love and continuously behaves like hes a suspect himself, the towns sheriff (John Ireland) appears to be in a constant state of drunkenness and doesnt even seem to care about who keeps raping & killing the women in his district, the female reporter is even too weird for words and the Galens (an old witch and her grandson) are just plain spooky. All together they desperately try to solve the mystery of whom or what exactly is destroying the towns women reproducing organs. The sequences building up towards the rapes & murders are admirably atmospheric and the vile acts themselves are bloody and unsettling. Basically these are very positive factors in a horror film, but the narrative structure is too incoherent and the characters are too unsympathetic for Incubus to be a really good film. Also, there are quite a few tedious parts to struggle yourself through (like footage of a Bruce Dickinson concert!) and the usually very reliable John Houghs direction is nearly unnoticeable. The final shot is effectively nightmarish, though. For me personally, Incubus was a bit of a disappointment, but there are still several enough reasons to recommend this odd piece of early 80s horror to open-minded genre fanatics.	movie
159	I swear if I did ever tried cocaine Id be able to relate to this film perfectly. Its pace, as well as the dialog, churns out at speeds that some viewers might need to stop and relax their heads.There are great little elements that pop up through out the film, like how Rob Lowes character seems to always be loosing a shoe, or how some characters keep running spirals around his zigzagged path. The story was put together extremely well and the direction seems flawless.The movie reeks of clumsy and cuteness. This is one I think most could enjoy. A few laugh-out-loud-even-if-you-are-alone moments ensure that Ill certainly be watching this again.	movie
160	I know that so many reviews on IMDb are extreme, with reviewers either praising a film to the hilt or inarticulately tearing it to pieces. I find neither of these kind of reviews helpful, and so I do not give this film the awful review I am about to, lightly. The film is art-house science-fiction of the worst kind dressed up as a Hollywood blockbuster. The trailers draw you in by showing you what appears to be a cohesive plot, but is actually just a tiny part of a wilfully baffling series of events which are never properly resolved. I like films which challenge the viewer and I do not need to be spoon-fed a plot, and so my complaint against this film is not that it is too highbrow. No - the film is just terrible. As the credits roll you will feel genuine anger at having wasted your time on Cameron Diazs wooden acting and a faltering plot-line. Avoid.	movie
161	In this critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on true events, Gabriel (Robin Williams), a celebrated writer and late-night talk show host, becomes captivated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother (Toni Collette). When troubling questions arise about this boys (story), however, Gabriel finds himself drawn into a widening mystery that hides a deadly secret according to films official synopsis.You really should STOP reading these comments, and watch the film NOW...The How did he lose his leg? ending, with Ms. Collette planning her new life, should be chopped off, and sent to deleted scenes land. Its overkill. The true nature of her physical and mental ailments should be obvious, by the time Mr. Williams returns to New York. Possibly, her blindness could be in question - but a revelation could have be made certain in either the highway or video tape scenes. The film would benefit from a re-editing - how about a directors cut? Williams and Bobby Cannavale (as Jess) dont seem, initially, believable as a couple. A scene or two establishing their relationship might have helped set the stage. Otherwise, the cast is exemplary. Williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization, and not a gay impersonation. Sandra Oh (as Anna), Joe Morton (as Ashe), and Rory Culkin (Pete Logand) are all perfect.Best of all, Collettes Donna belongs in the creepy hall of fame. Ms. Oh is correct in saying Collette might be, you know, like that guy from Psycho. There have been several years when organizations giving acting awards seemed to reach for women, due to a slighter dispersion of roles; certainly, they could have noticed Collette with some award consideration. She is that good. And, director Patrick Stettner definitely evokes Hitchcock - he even makes getting a sandwich from a vending machine suspenseful.Finally, writers Stettner, Armistead Maupin, and Terry Anderson deserve gratitude from flight attendants everywhere.******* The Night Listener (1/21/06) Patrick Stettner ~ Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Sandra Oh, Rory Culkin	movie
162	Although it was released way back in 1967, IN COLD BLOOD still remains the benchmark by which all true-crime films are matched. Veteran writer/director Richard Brooks (ELMER GANTRY) adapted Truman Capotes non-fiction book into a chilling docudrama that retains a disturbing power even today, thirty-five years later.Robert Blake and Scott Wilson portray Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, two ex-cons who, on a tip from Hicocks old cellmate Floyd Wells, broke into the Holcomb, Kansas home of Herbert Clutter, looking for a wall safe supposedly containing $10,000. But no safe was ever found, and the two men instead wound up killing Mr. Clutter, his wife, and their two children, getting away with only a radio, a pair of binoculars, and a lousy forty dollars. Two months on the run, including an aimless vacation in northern Mexico, ended in Las Vegas when cops caught them in a stolen car. But it eventually comes out, after merciless grilling by Kansas law enforcement officials, that these two men committed that heinous crime in Holcomb. Tried and convicted on four counts of murder, they stew in jail over a five-year period of appeals and denials until both are hanged to death on April 14, 1965.Blake and Smith are absolutely chilling as the two dispassionate killers who show no remorse for what theyve done but are concerned about getting caught. John Forsythe also does a good turn as Alvin Dewey, the chief detective investigating the crime, as does Gerald S. OLaughlin as his assistant. In a tactic that is both faithful to Capotes book and a good artistic gambit all around, Brooks does not show the murders at the beginning; instead, he shows the two killers pulling up to the Clutter house as the last light goes out, then cuts to the next morning and the horrifying discovery of the bodies. Only during the ride back to Kansas, when Blake is questioned by Forsythe and narrates the story, do we see the true horror of what happened that night. We dont see that much blood being spilled in these scenes, but we dont need to. The shotgun blasts and the horrified look on the Clutters faces as they know they are about to die are more than disturbing enough, so there is no need to resort to explicitly bloody slasher-film violence.Brooks wisely filmed IN COLD BLOOD in stark black-and-white, and the results are excellent thanks to Conrad Halls expertise. The chilling jazz score by Quincy Jones is the capper. The end result is one of the most unsettling films of any kind ever made, devastating in its own low-key fashion. It is a 134-minute study of a crime that shook an entire state and indeed an entire nation, and should be seen, though viewer discretion is advised; the R rating is there for a reason.	movie

164	This was a pleasant musical about the creation of the Moulin Rouge dance hall. In many ways, this reminds me of the Hollywood musicals of the 40s and 50s, in that it has many clichés leading up to the inevitable conclusion (will the show STILL go on?). While of course none of this is new, it was enjoyable and well made. The musical numbers at the end are frenetic and beautiful to watch. In many ways it reminds me of a sexier version of THE GREAT ZIEGFELD. In real life, Ziegfeld was quite the player but this was sanitized in the American film. But, in FRENCH CANCAN, the characters have fully functioning libidos--but nothing is really shown, so the movie is okay for kids.Nothing new but well done nevertheless.	movie
165	Agassi fear for Melbourne\n\nAndre Agassis involvement in the Australian Open was put in doubt after he pulled out of the Kooyong Classic with a hip injury.\n\nAgassi was serving at 5-6 down in the first set to fellow American Andy Roddick when he decided to bring a premature end to the match. My hip was cramping and I just could not continue, said the 34-year-old. Agassi, who has won the Australian Open four times, will have an MRI scan to discover the extent of the damage. He said the problem was not the same as the hip injury which forced him to miss Wimbledon last year.\n\nThe good news is that it didnt just tear, it was tightening up and that can be your body protecting itself, which is hopefully more of the issue, he added. That wasnt comfortable out there at all, what I was feeling. I have to wait and see what Im dealing with - its a pretty scary feeling out there when something doesnt feel right and is getting worse. Its very disappointing and Ill have to do my best to deal with it. Time will shortly tell if it (the Australian Open) is a possibility or not. I was not counting on this being the end of the day for me. Maybe in a few days Ill have a much better sense of what my hopes will be.\n	sport
166	This film captures the short moments between a mother and son in rural Russia, as she lays dying.I am so torn between being nice to the film or declaring it a test of patience. On one hand, the film is beautiful, with the sparse dialog capturing the essence of their feelings. There is really nothing to say, because everything that needs to be said is conveyed beyond words. The son shows so much care, love and patience towards his mother, that I think it is a celebration of unconditional love towards ones family. It also cruelly reminds me that I could be in a situation like this, stuck in a joyless place, having to take care of a very ill person. Mat I Syn is cruel reality.On the other hand, Mat I Syn moves really too slowly. Do I really need to watch a train passing by the horizon for over 1 minute? With my previous experience of Telets and Aleksandra, I am so tempted to put Mat I Syn among them as a total bore.I guess one has to be in the right state of mind to appreciate this film. I surely see the beauty of it, but maybe I am not in the right state of mind.	movie
167	Wales win in Rome\n\nWales secured their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in Rome.\n\nTries from Jonathan Thomas, Tom Shanklin and Martyn Williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. Luciano Orquera did reply with one for Italy but second-half efforts from Brent Cockbain, Shane Williams and Robert Sidoli sealed victory. Fly-half Stephen Jones added four conversions as Wales maintained their superb start to this years tournament. Starting full of confidence after their victory over England, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. Diminutive wing Shane Williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing Andrea Masi and Aaron Persico into the Italian half. His pass to Tom Shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and Michael Owens long cut-out pass gave the lurking Thomas an easy run-in.\n\nStephen Jones, who retained the kicking duties despite Gavin Hensons heroics against England, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. Wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.\n\nHenson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for England, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. But his attempted chip ahead was charged down by Orquera, who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. With the Welsh line-out stuttering and Italy twice turning the visitors scrum, the home sides forward power brought them back into it. But a clever high kick from Henson almost brought a try for Hal Luscombe when Roland de Marigny and Ludovico Nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.\n\nWales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try. Jones was unable to convert and De Marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for Italy. Henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but Wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.\n\nHenson sent Luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to Martyn Williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, Jones adding the conversion. Italy, who lost flanker Mauro Bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. De Marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a Nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. But Wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. Their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from Shane Williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock Cockbain. Before Italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from Gareth Thomas and great off-loads from Martyn Williams and replacement Kevin Morgan saw Shane Williams scamper over.\n\nWith Jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, Wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. The icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, Shane Williams and Ceri Sweeney combining to send Sidoli over in the left corner. The only downside for Wales was a hamstring injury suffered by Luscombe. But after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years, they will travel to Paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.\n\nR de Marigny; Mirco Bergamasco, W Pozzebon, A Masi, L Nitoglia; L Orquera, A Troncon; A Lo Cicero, F Ongaro, M Castrogiovanni, S Dellape, M Bortolami (capt), A Persico, Mauro Bergamasco, S Parisse.\n\nG Intoppa, S Perugini, CA del Fava, D dal Maso, P Griffen, M Barbini, KP Robertson.\n\nG Thomas (capt); H Luscombe, T Shanklin, G Henson, S Williams; S Jones, D Peel; G Jenkins, M Davies, A Jones; B Cockbain, R Sidoli; J Thomas, M Williams, M Owen.\n\nR McBryde, J Yapp, I Gough, R Sowden-Taylor, G Cooper, C Sweeney, K Morgan.\n\nAndrew Cole (Australia).\n	sport
168	Engrossing drama of four men on a canoing weekend down a remote river. They are pacifist Ed (Jon Voight), adventurous, violent Lewis (Burt Reynolds), obnoxious Bobby (Ned Beatty) and nice guy Drew (Ronny Cox). The first 40 minute are great--theres the incredible dueling banjos sequence, interesting interplay among the characters and just stunning widescreen cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond. Then two hillbillies attack Ed and Bobby. One of them rapes Bobby...and the trip becomes a nightmare.Just unbelievable. The scenery is incredibly beautiful yet this horrific violence is taking place. To be truthful, Beattys rape has never bothered me--Im very aware its being faked despite the good acting. This movie also shows how the characters change--Ed has his pacifism tested, Lewis becomes weak, Bobby is violated by one of the people he mocked earlier on and Drew tries to keep himself sane. Direction by John Boorman is also very assured and the sounds of the forest and the river help the mood immensely.The acting is mostly good. Voight is just OK in the lead--hes been better. Beatty is also just OK--but it is his debut film and he has guts for taking such a risky role. Cox is very good especially when things start falling apart. And Reynolds is just superb--one of his best acting jobs EVER! How this wasnt even nominated for an Academy Award escapes me. Also Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward are way too believable as the hillbillies.A powerful film--NOT for children. Try to see an uncut version--the TV version is butchered. Also letter-boxed viewing is essential to capture the breathtaking images.	movie
169	Moya clinches Cup for Spain\n\nSpain won the Davis Cup for the second time in their history when Carlos Moya beat the USAs Andy Roddick in the fourth rubber in Seville.\n\nMoya won 6-2 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-5) to give the hosts an unassailable 3-1 lead with only one singles rubber remaining. Roddick battled hard and had chances in the second set, but Moyas clay-court expertise proved the difference. Mardy Fish beat Tommy Robredo 7-6 (8-6) 6-2 in the final dead rubber to cut Spains winning margin to 3-2. Spains only other Davis Cup title came in 2000, when they beat Australia in Barcelona. This time they chose to play the final in Seville and the citys Olympic Stadium was revamped to allow for a record crowd for a competitve tennis event of 27,000 spectators. And the home fans gave vociferous support to their players, with 18-year-old Nadal and Moya winning both Fridays singles rubbers. American twins Mike and Bob Bryan gave the visitors hope with victory over Juan Carlos Ferrero and Tommy Robredo in Saturdays doubles. But it remained an uphill task for a US team far happier on hard courts than clay, and 1998 French Open champion Moya had too much for world number two Roddick. This has been incredible - the moment Ive been waiting for for years, said Moya, who missed out in 2000 through injury. Ive prepared myself for this day. I knew that playing on clay I would have my chances to win.\n\nThe Davis Cup is my dream. I cant ask for more. There is nothing bigger than what Ive lived today. Moya stormed into a 4-0 lead on his way to taking the first set against Roddick and recovered immediately from dropping serve in the second. The match came down to two tie-breaks and Moya dominated both, clinching victory on his third match point. Wild celebrations followed, with an emotional Moya congratulated by his team-mates, including Nadal, who at 18 years and 187 days becomes the youngest ever victor in Davis Cup history. I think we put up a better fight here than in Paris two years ago, said Roddick, who was on the US team which lost to France in the 2002 semi-finals at Roland Garros. They were just better than us this weekend. I have nothing to be ashamed of, I gave it my all. I am not going to walk out of here with my head down, thats for sure. Theres no miracle answer. We have to improve.\n	sport

171	A friend of mine bought this film for £1, and even then it was grossly overpriced. Despite featuring big names such as Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and the incredibly talented Burt Young, this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole. It uses tired, bottom of the barrel comedic techniques - consistently breaking the fourth wall as Sandler talks to the audience, and seemingly pointless montages of hot girls.Adam Sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women. When the ships resident comedian - the shamelessly named Dickie due to his unfathomable success with the opposite gender - is presumed lost at sea, Sandlers character Shecker gets his big break. Dickie is not dead, hes rather locked in the bathroom, presumably sea sick.Perhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time.	movie
172	Okay, okay, maybe not THE greatest. I mean, The Exorcist and Psycho and a few others are hard to pass up, but The Shining is way up there. It is, however, by far the best Stephen King story that has been made into a movie. Its better than The Stand, better than Pet Sematary (if not quite as scary), better than Cujo, better than The Green Mile, better the Dolores Claiborne, better than Stand By Me (just barely, though), and yes, its better than The Shawshank Redemption (shut up, its better), I dont care WHAT the IMDb Top 250 says. I read that, a couple of decades ago, Stanley Kubrick was sorting through novels at his home trying to find one that might make a good movie, and from the other room, his wife would hear a pounding noise every half hour or so as he threw books against the wall in frustration. Finally, she didnt hear any noise for almost two hours, and when she went to check and see if he had died in his chair or something (I tell this with all due respect, of course), she found him concentrating on a book that he had in his hand, and the book was The Shining. And thank God, too, because he went on to convert that book into one of the best horror films ever.Stephen King can be thanked for the complexity of the story, about a man who takes his wife and son up to a remote hotel to oversee it during the extremely isolated winter as he works on his writing. Jack Nicholson can be thanked for his dead-on performance as Jack Torrance (how many movies has Jack been in where he plays a character named Jack?), as well as his flawless delivery of several now-famous lines (`Heeeeeeres Johnny!!). Shelley Duvall can be thanked for giving a performance that allows the audience to relate to Jacks desires to kill her. Stanley Kubrick can be thanked for giving this excellent story his very recognizable touch, and whoever the casting director was can be thanked for scrounging up the creepiest twins on the planet to play the part of the murdered girls.One of the most significant aspects of this movie, necessary for the story as a whole to have its most significant effect, is the isolation, and its presents flawlessly. The film starts off with a lengthy scene following Jack as he drives up to the old hotel for his interview for the job of the caretaker for the winter. This is soon followed by the same thing following Jack and his family as they drive up the windy mountain road to the hotel. This time the scene is intermixed with shots of Jack, Wendy, and Danny talking in the car, in which Kubrick managed to sneak in a quick suggestion about the evils of TV, as Wendy voices her concern about talking about cannibalism in front of Danny, who says that its okay because hes already seen it on TV (`See? Its okay, he saw it on the television.).The hotel itself is the perfect setting for a story like this to take place, and its bloody past is made much more frightening by the huge, echoing rooms and the long hallways. These rooms with their echoes constantly emphasize the emptiness of the hotel, but it is the hallways that really created most of the scariness of this movie, and Kubricks traditional tracking shots give the hallways a creepy three-dimensional feel. Early in the film, there is a famous tracking shot that follows Danny in a large circle as he rides around the halls on his Big Wheel (is that what those are called?), and his relative speed (as well as the clunking made by the wheels as he goes back and forth from the hardwood floors to the throw rugs) gives the feeling of not knowing what is around the corner. And being a Stephen King story, you EXPECT something to jump out at you. I think that the best scene in the halls (as well as one of the scariest in the film) is when Danny is playing on the floor, and a ball rolls slowly up to him. He looks up and sees the long empty hallway, and because the ball is something of a childs toy, you expect that it must have been those horrendously creepy twins that rolled it to him. Anyway, you get the point. The Shining is a damn scary movie.Besides having the rare quality of being a horror film that doesnt suck, The Shining has a very in depth story that really keeps you guessing and leaves you with a feeling that there was something that you missed. HAD Jack always been there, like Mr. Grady told him in the mens room? Was he really at that ball in 1921, or is that just someone who looks exactly like him? If he has always been the caretaker, as Mr. Grady also said, does that mean that it was HIM that went crazy and killed his wife and twin daughters, and not Mr. Grady, after all? Its one thing for a film to leave loose ends that should have been tied, thats just mediocre filmmaking. For example, The Amityville Horror, which obviously copied much of The Shining as far as its subject matter, did this. But it is entirely different when a film is presented in a way that really makes you think (as mostly all of Kubricks movies are). One more thing that we can all thank Stanley Kubrick for, and we SHOULD thank him for, is for not throwing this book against the wall. That one toss would have been cinematic tragedy.	movie
216	Why remake the original Assault? To my mind Assault was Carpenters true masterpiece. It had all the elements good Carpenter movies contain. External threat on a small group of individuals. People taking the challenge because they are forced to do so. Isolation! Just remember, the guns in Carpenters original made no sound, being thus a lot more threatening than conventional devices. And now this remake. Concentrating on main character Is psychology and on his relation to main character II (the evil but honorable). The anonymous threat in the Carpenter movie replaced by a rather conventional conspiracy/corruption background. The remakers just didnt understand the main plot of the original. And thus produced something pretty ordinary.	movie
173	LSE doubts boost bidders shares\n\nShares in Deutsche Boerse have risen more than 3% after a shareholder fund voiced opposition to the firms planned takeover of the London Stock Exchange.\n\nTCI, which claims to represent owners of 5% of Deutsche Boerses (DB) shares, has complained that the £1.35bn ($2.5bn) offer for the LSE is too high. Opposition from TCI has fuelled speculation that the proposed takeover could fail. Rival exchange operator Euronext has also said it may bid for the LSE. Euronext operates the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon bourses, while Deutsche Boerse runs the Frankfurt exchange.\n\nBBC News spoke to a number of analysts on Monday morning about shareholder worries over Deutsche Boerses bid for LSE. Although none were prepared to speak on the record, most thought it was unlikely that TCIs opposition would halt the deal\n\nObviously well have to wait and see, but I dont think it will make much difference. Deutsche Boerse appears very committed, said one London-based broker. He forecast the takeover bid would succeed and was more concerned to see improvements in the daily running of the LSE. In voicing its opposition to the planned takeover, TCI said it would prefer to see Deutsche Boerse return $500m (£350m) to shareholders. The Deutsche Boerse was prepared to pay for the LSE exceeds the potential benefits of this acquisition, said TCI.\n\nAnother Deutsche Boerse shareholder on Monday also appeared to back TCIs call. Another investor in Deutsche Boerse has supported the view that a payout to shareholders would be preferable to Deutsche Boerse overpaying for the LSE, Reuters news agency reported. We prefer a sensible entrepreneurial solution at a price that is not too high, said Rolf Dress, a spokesman for Union Investment. If that cannot be achieved, then we would wish for a distribution of liquid assets to shareholders. The Financial Times also reported a third Deutsche Boerse shareholder as opposed to the deal. It quoted a spokesman for US-based hedge fund Atticus Capital complaining that the planned takeover appeared to be motivated by empire-building rather than the best interests of shareholders.\n\nTCI has called for Deutsche Boerse to hold an emergency general meeting to discuss the bid for LSE. Yet under German business law, DB does not have to gain shareholder approval before making a significant acquisition. Deutsche Boerse said TCIs opposition would not change its bid approach. Deutsche Boerse is convinced that its contemplated cash acquisition of the London Stock Exchange is in the best interests of its shareholders and the company, it said. DBs shares were up 3.4% to 45.25 euros by 1030 GMT, the highest gainer in Frankfurt.\n	business
174	This film is full of interesting ideas. Some scenes are truly hilarious. The dialogs are witty and colloquial. The tension in the film comes not so much from the murder mystery plot as from the relationship between the characters. The film tells two stories in parallel.The first story involves the characters played by Trintignant and Kassovitz. Trintignant is an ageing drifter, with a somewhat ridiculous macho toughness, who is followed by a naive young man played by Kassovitz with plenty of good-natured smiles. Many good moments in the film come from the contrast between the two characters, for example when Trintignant tries to teach Kassovitz how to be intimidating.The second story tells how a salesman,played by Jean Yanne, gives up his job and his wife to find the murderer of a young friend. Yanne plays the part with a kind of aggressive irony. I wish I could describe this better.After a while the viewer understands how both stories are connected and they meet indeed in the end, in a surprising but also logical ending.The film is a successful mixture of the witty but superficial gangster films the directors father (the celebrated Michel Audiard) used to write, and the typical french film with lots of psychological depth and lots of care in the display of emotions.	movie
175	Gaming firm to sell UK dog tracks\n\nSix UK greyhound tracks have been put up for sale by gaming group Wembley as part of a move which will lead to the break-up of the group.\n\nWembley announced the planned sale as it revealed it was to offload its US gaming division to BLB Investors. US gaming consortium BLB will pay $339m (£182.5m) for the US unit, although the deal is subject to certain conditions. BLB holds a 22% stake in Wembley and last year came close to buying the whole firm in a £308m takeover deal. Shares in Wembley were up 56 pence, or 7.6%, at 797p by mid-morning.\n\nThe sale of the US gaming unit will leave Wembley with its UK business. This includes greyhound tracks at Wimbledon in London, Belle Vue in Manchester, Perry Barr and Hall Green in Birmingham, Oxford and Portsmouth. Analysts have valued the six tracks at between £40m-£50m. The US business accounts for about 90% of Wembleys operating profit and consists of operations in Rhode Island and Colorado. BLBs purchase of the US unit is subject to the agreement of a revenue-sharing deal being struck with Rhode Island authorities. Wembley said that, once the deal was completed, it anticipated returning surplus cash to shareholders. Whilst the completion of the sale of the US Gaming Division remains subject to a number of conditions, we believe this development is a positive step towards the maximisation of value for shareholders, said Wembley chairman Claes Hultman. Wembley sold the English national football stadium in 1999 to concentrate on its gaming operations.\n	business

Or perhaps by watching paint dry. Those two employments would have at least engaged my mind a bit more than India Song. The most frustrating part of sitting through this was that I could see what moods/atmospheres were trying to be created and the notion of these could have been interesting if they had been fleshed out more. Instead, what happened was a presentation of an incoherent, silly chain of nonevents - with the same scenes rehashed over and over to beat some sort of point into our senses.I was loathe to devote more time to this film by writing any sort of review, except to perhaps warn other folks against this waste of time.	movie
178	Indian oil firm eyes Yukos assets\n\nIndias biggest oil exploration firm, Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), says it is in talks to buy the former assets of troubled Russian crude producer Yukos.\n\nWe are in touch with the concerned Russian entities about the Yukos assets and other opportunities in Russia, said ONGC chairman Subir Raha. Local press had reported that ONGC was looking to buy 15% of Yukos former key oil production unit for $2bn (£1bn). Yukos is being broken up by Russian authorities to pay a massive tax bill.\n\nIt was forced to sell its key production unit Yuganskneftegas (Yugansk) last month after being hit with a bill of $27bn in unpaid taxes and fines.\n\nState-owned Rosneft now owns Yugansk and Russia has said it will turn the oil producer into a stand-alone firm. Indian oil minister Mani Shankar Aiyar discussed ONGCs plans during a trip to Moscow last year, and the topic came up again during Russian president Vladimir Putins recent visit to New Delhi. It would make great sense for us to build on that, said Mr Aiyar. Indias oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies. India imports about 70% of its total oil consumption. At the same time, Indias economy is booming and the countrys thirst for oil is so strong that it has helped pushed up the price of crude worldwide.\n\nIndia produces about 793,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), little changed since the start of the 1990s, according to oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood. Consumption, meanwhile, has jumped to 2.4 million bpd, compared with 474,000 bpd in 1973.\n\nFor countries to develop, they have to have access to energy, said John Westwood, managing director of oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood. India is a dramatically growing economy that must have access to oil. By buying into Yugansk, ONGC would be able to reduce its dependence on Gulf states for oil imports, Mr Westwood explained, especially as the chances of finding and exploiting resources within India are slim. We forecast that Indian production will go into significant decline, Mr Westwood said. By 2020, production may only be at half of todays levels. ONGC, which is majority-owned by the Indian state, already has bought petroleum assets in countries including Vietnam, Sudan and Russia. The company is a partner with Rosneft in the Sakhalin-1 oil field off Russias Siberian coast.\n\nONGC is, however, not the only firm interested in Yugansk.\n\nChinese crude company China National Petroleum has also been mentioned as a possible investor, while on Thursday, Italy refused to rule out an interest. ONGCs interest is the latest twist in a saga that has seen one of the worlds biggest oil producers brought to its knees. The dispute is partly driven by President Putins clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is currently in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion. Yukos has been battling the Russian authorities for more than a year and has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US. Analysts have questioned how long it can continue to survive without Yugansk. On Thursday, a US court said it will hear arguments for Yukos bankruptcy claim to be thrown out on 16 February. Should that happen, Yukos will have little chance of clawing back its assets, analysts said.\n	business

180	CSA could close, says minister\n\nMinisters would not rule out scrapping the Child Support Agency if it failed to improve, Work and Pensions Secretary Alan Johnson has warned.\n\nBut he said replacing the controversial CSA would be the nuclear option. A report by the Commons work and pensions committee called for the agency to be wound up unless it improved its service within weeks. Chairman Sir Archy Kirkwood said: If the agency cannot be rescued, then it must be replaced.\n\nThe committee reached its conclusions after it found that nearly 250,000 cases have yet to be processed. It warned that it could be five years before the CSA was fit for purpose, describing it as a failing organisation and in crisis with parents facing payment delays and inaccurate maintenance calculations. The report urged the CSA to draw up contingency plans, including the abandonment option, to be presented to Parliament by Easter, in case the CS2 computer system could not be made to work.\n\nAnd responding to calls for the agency to be scrapped, Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4s Today programme: I certainly wouldnt rule out the nuclear option of moving to a completely new system. But I think the select committee would agree with me we would only do that when we were absolutely convinced that this system just isnt going to work.\n\nThe MPs launched their inquiry into the CSAs performance after it became clear that, despite the introduction of a simpler system of calculating maintenance payments for new cases in 2003, a backlog of claims was building up. The MPs found the £456m system from American IT giant EDS was nowhere near being fully functional and the number of dissatisfied, disenchanted and angry customers continues to escalate. Faced with the committees criticism, the government has suspended its plan to cut the agencys staff by 25%. The CSA has been surrounded in controversy since its introduction in 1993 to assess and enforce child support payments by absent parents.\n\nIt is currently chasing outstanding payments of more than £720m, while a further £947m has been designated as unrecoverable.\n\nMichelle, a mother of twins, said she had not received a penny of the £57 a week she should be receiving from her ex-partner and had faced an on-going battle with the CSA. Her forms have twice been lost in the post, she said. I dont receive correspondence, I dont receive phone calls, I have to chase them all the time, she said. Theresa May, Tory shadow work and pensions secretary, said: We have got to find a way thats going to ensure those payments get through to the people who are due them. The agencys former chief executive Doug Smith quit last autumn claiming he was seriously disappointed with its performance. The committee said the National Audit Office should investigate why the EDS system had gone so badly wrong. It blamed the agencys senior management for a multitude of problems within the agency, including for an apparent lack of training of frontline staff.\n	politics
181	I know that to include everything in the book, the film would have to have been several hours long, so I think they did their best to include things that were crucial and pivotal to the story. I thought the casting was great, the children who played Amir and Hassan were very good actors. And the guy who played Amir as an adult was great! The scenes between him and Baba were especially touching. I thought the locations they used were interesting... scenes set in Afghanistan were shot in China, and one scene that took place in Fremont, CA (the graduation scene) was actually shot on Treasure Island in San Francisco. I worked one day as an extra on Kite Runner and it was that day, the day they shot the graduation scene. We reported to Treasure Island in the morning, they checked everyones wardrobe to make sure it looked like the late 80s, an then we took our places in the audience. They shot the scene over and over again until they were happy with it. It was cool to see the actors up close and also to see the books author, who was on hand as a story consultant. I thought this book was excellent and I recommend both the book and the movie to anyone. This is a moving story about friendship, love, guilt and eventual redemption. There is a way to be good again.	movie
185	Indy buys into India paper\n\nIrish publishing group Independent News & Media is buying up a 26% stake in Indian newspaper company Jagran in a deal worth 25m euros ($34.1m).\n\nJagran publishes Indias top-selling daily newspaper, the Hindi-language Dainik Jagran, which has been in circulation for 62 years. News of the deal came as the group announced that its results would meet market forecasts. The company reported strong revenue growth across all its major markets.\n\nGroup advertising revenues were up over 10% year-on-year, the group said, with overall circulation revenues are expected to increase almost 10% year-on-year. This was helped by the positive impact of compact newspaper editions in Ireland and the UK, it said. 2004 has proven to be an important year for Independent News & Media, said chief executive Sir Anthony OReilly. Our simple aim at Independent is to be the low cost producer in every region in which we operate. I am confident that we will show a meaningful increase in earnings for 2005.\n\nMeanwhile, the group made no comment about the future of the Independent newspaper despite recent speculation that Sir Anthony had held talks with potential buyers over a stake in the daily publication. He has consistently denied suggestions that the Independent and the Independent on Sunday are up for sale. Buy it is understood that the recent success of the smaller edition of the Independent, which has pushed circulation up by 20% to 260,000, has prompted interest from industry rivals, with Daily Mail & General Trust tipped as the most likely suitor. The loss-making newspaper is not expected to reach break-even until 2006.\n	business
186	EU China arms ban to be lifted\n\nThe EU embargo on arms exports to China is likely to be lifted in the next six months despite US objections, UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has said.\n\nThe 15-year-old ban was imposed in the aftermath of Chinas crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square. Mr Straw told a Commons select committee human rights concerns over China remained. But he said it was wrong to put China under the same embargo as countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma.\n\nIn December, the EU pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet. The EUs move was welcomed at the time by Beijing, which described the embargo as a product of the Cold War. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and French President Jacques Chirac have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted. Britain has been more cautious on the issue, but on Wednesday Mr Straw said he also wanted it to end. I have long understood Chinas argument, that to lump them in with, say, Burma and Zimbabwe is not appropriate and I dont think it is, he told the joint committee on Strategic Export Controls. He said it is more likely than not that the ban would be lifted before Britain takes over the presidency of the EU from Luxembourg in July. But he said an EU code of conduct would prevent an increase in the number of arms being exported to the country. If it is lifted we will end up with as effective arms controls in relation to China as we have now.\n\nMr Straw said the US government was suspicious of the motives of some other countries within the EU in wanting the ban lifted. But he said many of Washingtons objections were based on a lack of information and understanding of how export control guidelines worked in EU countries. And intense discussions were taking place with US officials to convince them it was the right thing to do. Washington is thought to fear it would lead to a buying spree for arms that could be used by China to threaten its diplomatic rival Taiwan. US officials say they are not satisfied the mechanisms in the EU code of conduct are robust enough to prevent abuses. US Undersecretary of State John Bolton is meeting British officials this week to press the case for keeping the embargo.\n	politics
187	Hearts of Oak 3-2 Cotonsport\n\nHearts of Oak set up an all Ghanaian Confederation Cup final with a 3-2 win over Cameroons Cotonsport Garoua in Accra on Sunday.\n\nThe win for Hearts means they will play Asante Kotoko in the two-leg final, after the Kumasi team qualified from Group A on Saturday. In the other Group B game Cameroons\n\nbeat\n\nof South Africa 3-2 in Douala, neither side could have qualified for the final. Hearts of Oak started the game needing a win to qualify for the final while Cotonsport only needed to avoid defeat to go through. Louis Agyemang scored the first two goals for Hearts either side of half time before Ben Don Bortey scored the third. Hearts looked set for a comfortable win but Cotonsport staged a late fight back scoring twice late on. First of all Boukar Makaji scored in the 89th minute and then 3 minutes into injury time at the end of the game Andre Nzame III was on target. But it was too little too late for the Cameroonians and Hearts held on to win the game and a place in the final. The first leg of the final will be played in Accra on the weekend of 27-28 November and the second leg two weeks later on the 11 December in Kumasi. In the other Group B game Cameroons Sable Batie took the lead in the 35th minute through Kemadjou before Santos equalised on the hour mark thanks to Thokozani Xaba . Bernard Ngom put Sable ahead just five minutes later and then Ernest Nfor settled the game on 68 minutes. Ruben Cloete scored the South African sides consolation with just three minutes left on the clock.\n	sport

189	Watching Marlen Brando on screen is like watching a master carpenter chiseling intricate details into a piece of mahogany. Brandos acting is the ONLY thing that makes this movie watchable. The plot is inane and laughable (not comic). The other big name actors seem to be making desperate attempts to give the characters they portray some modicum of humanity... these characters have the humanity of wet cardboard. Everything about the technical side of this film is either mediocre or just plain awful. The director throws freeze-frame and slow-motion shots about with impunity. The incidental music is cartoonish and destroys any hint of dramatic effect. Its not something I really look for in a movie, but even the wardrobe was way off. The venerable Brando couldnt take focus away from the awful rags they had him decked out in. Ive heard this movie called David Lynch-esquire and irreverently funny... it is neither. David Lynch films are borne of wicked creativity - this film was in no way creative. And dont confuse irreverence with stupidity.	movie

The actors are way overacting, the special effects are ridiculous and there is not any plot that makes any sense. This is the worst martial arts movie Ive ever seen and I have seen plenty!	movie

The set up is so predictable as to ruin the movie, even if the rest of the movie was good (which it isnt) Theres almost no chemistry between the leads, and Steve Carells stalker-ish behavior is embarrassing, not funny. Its hard to believe Binoches character would have any interest in him. Then in the end its all wrapped up so wonderful and everyone lives happily ever after. Isnt that great America!	movie
193	Music mogul Fuller sells company\n\nPop Idol supremo Simon Fuller has sold his 19 Entertainment company to an US entrepreneur in a $156m (£81.5m) deal.\n\nRobert Sillermans Sports Entertainment Enterprises, which is to be renamed CFX, recently also bought an 85% share in the estate of Elvis Presley. Mr Fuller has been appointed to the CFX board and will plan and implement the companys creative strategy. The 19 firm handles a roster of music artists, TV shows and PR strategies for stars including the Beckhams. The deal sees Mr Fuller receive £64.5m in cash and about 1.9 million shares in Sports Entertainment. There will also be a further £19.2m in either cash or stocks by the end of the financial year in June. Mr Fuller has signed a long-term agreement with the company which will see him continue to expand and develop entertainment brands. He said: This is a hugely exciting new partnership for myself and 19 Entertainment.\n\nCKX will provide 19 with a powerful platform for global growth and allow us to fully take advantage of all the amazing opportunities that lie ahead. I cannot wait to get started.\n\nMr Fuller was the creative drive behind Pop Idol and its US offspring American Idol. 19 Management runs the careers of many of its successful contestants including Will Young, Gareth Gates and Kelly Clarkson. The company was set up 15 years ago by Mr Fuller, taking the name from his first successful single - 19 by Paul Hardcastle. Fuller was the driving force behind the Spice Girls phenomenon, using canny marketing and catchy pop songs to secure their place as the most lucrative girl group in history. He then put together S Club 7, who had their own TV show as well as a music career. Mr Sillermans deal to buy the Presley estate sees him control the operation of Graceland, as well as money from the late stars music and films. Presleys daughter Lisa Marie retains possession of Graceland and many of her fathers personal effects.\n	entertainment
194	Pop band Busted to take a break\n\nChart-topping pop band Busted have confirmed that they plan to take a break, following rumours that they were on the verge of splitting.\n\nA statement from the bands record company Universal said frontman Charlie Simpson planned to spend some time working with his other band, Fightstar. However they said that Busted would reconvene in due course. The band have had eight top three hits, including four number ones, since they first hit the charts in 2002. Their singles include What I Go To School For, Year 3000, Crashed The Wedding, You Said No, and Whos David?\n\nThe band, which also includes members Matt Jay and James Bourne, made the top ten with their self-titled debut album, as well as the follow-up, A Present For Everyone, in 2003. They won best pop act and best breakthrough act at the 2004 Brit Awards and were nominated for best British group. Most recently they topped the charts with the theme from the live-action film version of Thunderbirds, which was voted Record Of The Year on the ITV1 show. The band have capitalised on a craze for artists playing catchy pop music with rock overtones. The trio are seen as an alternative to more manufactured artists who are not considered credible musicians because they do not write their own songs or play their own instruments. However, recent rumours have suggested that Simpson has been wanting to quit the band to focus on Fightstar. He now plans to take Fightstar on tour.\n	entertainment
195	Lewis-Francis turns to Christie\n\nMark Lewis-Francis has stepped up his preparations for the new season by taking advice from British sprint icon Linford Christie.\n\nThe 22-year-old is set to compete at Sheffield this weekend and will then take on Maurice Greene and Kim Collins in Birmingham on 18 February. Training in Wales and getting advice from Linford Christie is broadening my mind, said Lewis-Francis. The sprinter has also shed weight since winning relay gold at the Athens Games. Last year I was 91kg, now I am 86.9kg - hopefully my times will come down, he said. This has been brought about by eating the right foods and cutting out the snacks. It is just discipline and being more focused about what I am doing.\n\nI am still keeping up my weights work and I can see the improvement in my running. Despite playing his part in Britains successful 4x100m relay team, Lewis-Francis still feels the frustration of missing out on the individual 100m final at the 2004 Olympics. That was heartbreaking, but I had made it to the semi-final and for me, on a personal level, that was an achievement. I just have to be patient and build up for the next Olympics. That is my goal and whatever I do between now and then will be geared to making the final.\n	sport
196	Fresh hope after Argentine crisis\n\nThree years after Argentina was hit by a deadly economic crisis, there is fresh hope.\n\nThe countrys economy is set to grow about 8% this year after seeing 9% growth last year, a sharp turnaround from 2002 when output fell 11%. The unemployment rate is improving, too: It is set to slip below 13% by the end of the year, down from 20% in May 2002. True, problems remain, but the overall picture is one of vast improvement. Even the International Monetary Fund (IMF) admits this. The Argentine authorities are proud, should be proud, of the strong performance of the economy, Thomas Dawson, an IMF director, said earlier this month.\n\nArgentina has made a remarkable recovery from a hideous and lengthy recession which in 2001 culminated in the government halting debt repayments to its private creditors. The debt default sparked a deep and prolonged economic crisis which, at least initially, was made worse by the governments decisions. Pension payments were halted and bank accounts frozen as part of austerity measures introduced by the government to deal with the countrys massive debts. In response, angry crowds of ordinary Argentines took to the streets where dozens of lives were lost in clashes with the police. Two presidents and at least three finance minister resigned in less than a month. Argentina was on the brink of collapse. The fix was found in the currency markets with the abandonment of the pesos decade-long peg to the US dollar in February 2002. The subsequent devaluation saw thousands of peoples life savings disappear. Scathes of companies went bust. Three years ago, every sector [of the economy] was hit by the crisis, said entrepreneur Drayton Valentine. It really was dire.\n\nBut since then, the general mood on the ground has improved dramatically, in part because the devaluation helped attract fresh direct investment from abroad and stimulate business within Brazil. Agriculture and tourism are helping, said entrepreneur Drayton Valentine.\n\nMr Valentine, who was born in the United States but grew up in Argentina, was fortunate: At the time of the crisis, his savings were held in dollar accounts abroad. But now he is using his money to help with the start-up a trading company. He explained that initially, his firm is going to export building materials to Spain and United States. Then, he would like to diversify to other areas, depending on the market. Locally there is a sense of recovery, many companies are exporting now, he said, noting that a lot of firms, which were closed during the crisis, are re-opening.\n\nBut not all that shines is gold. Argentina is still burdened by its failure to pay private creditors at the end of 2001. President Nestor Kirchners administration is still trying to hammer out an agreement with the creditors, but with the debts nominal value standing at around $100bn it is not proving easy. Debt defaults make further lending agreements both difficult and expensive to negotiate. Argentinas current offer implies that the creditors would get just 25 cents for each dollar they are owed, according to the creditors. Understandably, they want more and until they do, both they and others are loath to continue lending. For President Kirchner, this proves a hopeless challenge. Real losses have been suffered and somebody has to pay, observed Jack Boorman, adviser to IMFs managing director, Rodrigo Rato. Everyone needs to keep in mind the enormous cost on the part of both creditors and the Argentine society and people that will have been endured by the time a settlement is reached, he said. The cost is enormous, and continues to be paid, and will not be reversed by any restructuring.\n\nWith the international negotiations being troubled, it is of little help to President Kirchner that the domestic situation remains strained as well.\n\nThis is partly because there are still bank account holders who are waiting to recover some of their deposits. The situation is bad for those who had previously chosen to save in Argentina,  said Carlos Baez Silva, president of AARA, an association that represents bank account and bond holders. Few people have recovered more than about half their savings, Mr Baez Silva estimated, pointing out that many of the savers who have lost out are pensioners or others who once trusted the government, people who set aside money for the future in the belief that their investment would be safe. A lot of them invested in good faith, he said. The Argentine state responded by taking most of their investments. The affair has made Mr Baez Silva disillusioned with the countrys legal system. On occasion, the Supreme Court has ruled against the interests of the people he represents, he says, insisting that the system cannot be trusted. People have to deposit their money in the banks, not necessarily because they trust them but because crime is so high that people cannot have their money in their homes beneath their mattresses. Mr Valentine, who was born in the United States but grew up in Argentina, agreed. If I have to save pesos [the local currency] there is not much problem, but I will think twice before I deposit dollars in a bank.\n	business

With this show, its fat unfunny comedian Kevin James as Doug Hefferman who works as a delivery driver for a parcel service. He has a pretty wife, Carrie (Leah Remini), who works as legal assistant, and senile father-in-law, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), who lives in his daughter and son-in-laws basement. Kevin James Doug is your typical beer drinking, sports loving, TV watching slob of a sitcom husband who would rather watch the tube than deal with his marital issues. He also has a couple of idiot friends who lend extra stupidity to the problems encountered by this shows couple. Beyond the few laughs supplied by Jerry Stillers crazy old man character this show was generally unfunny. Kevin James imbecilic behavior usually caused the shows problems that usually resolved by his wife. This show continued a run of sitcoms with the fat stupid father/husband and their pretty wives that all seemed to run on ABC for some reason.	movie
199	Maléfique is an example of how a horror film can be effective with nothing more than a well-executed plot and a lot of heart. Its cast doesnt have recognized names, it doesnt have a big budget and it certainly lacks in the visual effects aspect; but it compensates all that with an intelligent and well-written script, an effective cast and the vision of a director focused more on telling the story than in delivering cheap thrills. Eric Valette may not be a well-know name yet, but with Maléfique, his feature length debut, he proves he is at the level of contemporaries like Jeunet, Gans or Aja.The film is the story of four prisoners in a cell, four different men with very different backgrounds but with one single goal: to get out. Carrère (Gérald Laroche) gets imprisoned after being declared guilty of a multi-millionaire fraud; his cell-mates, the violent Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), the intellectual Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) and the mentally challenged Pâquerette (Dimitri Rataud), are all convicted for murder and give Carrère a cold welcome. Their personalities will clash as Carrère discovers an ancient book detailing how a former prisoner escaped using black magic.Written by Alexandre Charlo and Franck Magnier, Maléfique is a great mix of dark fantasy and horror in a way very reminiscent of Clive Barkers stories. The movies strongest point is the way it builds up the characters, they are all have very complex and different personalities and a lot of the tension and suspense comes from their constant clash of personalities. The storys supernatural element is very well-handled and overall gives the film the feeling of reading a Gothic novel. Despite being a movie about four men locked in a room, the movie never gets boring or tiresome and in fact, the isolation of the group increases the feeling of distrust, claustrophobia, and specially, paranoia.Director Eric Valette makes a great use of atmosphere, mood and his cast to give life to the plot. Despite its obvious lack of budget, he has crafted a brilliant film that feels original, fresh and very attractive. His subtle and effective camera-work helps to make the film dynamic despite its single location, and the slow pace the film unfolds is excellent to create the heavy atmosphere of isolation and distrust the movie bases its plot. The very few displays of special effects are very well-done and Valette trades quantity for quality in the few but terrific scenes of gore.The characters are what make this film work, and the cast definitely deserves some of the credit. Gérald Laroche is excellent as Carrère, a man at first sight innocent, but who hides a dark past. Philippe Laudenbach and Dimitri Rataud are very effective too, specially Rataud in his very demanding role. However, is Clovis Cornillac who steal the show with his performance as Marcus, a violent and disturbed man who deep inside only wants to be himself. The characters are superbly developed and the cast makes the most of them.The movie is terrific, but it is not without its share of flaws. Of course, the most notorious one is its the low-budget. Some of the CGI-effects are a bit poor compared to the effective make-up and prosthetics used in other scenes, however, it is never too bad for it. Probably the bad thing about Maléfique is that it seems to lose some steam by the end when it focuses on the supernatural black magic rather than in the characters, not too much of a bad thing but the ending may seem weak from that point of view.Anyways, Maléfique is another one of those great horror films coming out from France lately, and one that deserves to have more recognition. Valette is definitely a talent to follow as this modest (albeit complex) tale of the supernatural is prove enough of his abilities. Personally, this film is a new favorite. 8/10	movie
200	Iranian misses Israel match\n\nIranian striker Vahid Hashemian will not travel to Israel for Bayern Munichs Champions League match against Maccabi Tel Aviv on Wednesday.\n\nThe German club said the player had pulled out because of a back injury. Iran refuses to recognise Israels right to exist and does not allow its citizens to travel to the country. A Bayern spokesman said on Monday that the decision not to take Hashemian to Israel had been motivated only by his physical condition. Hes got back pain and he couldnt train, the spokesman said. It would have made no sense for him to go. Iran gave judo world champion Arash Miresmaeili a $125,000 reward when he refused to fight an Israeli at the Athens Olympics. The International Judo Federation considered taking action against Miresmaeili but concluded he had been overweight for the fight and could not have taken part.\n	sport

220	US adds more jobs than expected\n\nThe US economy added 337,000 jobs in October - a seven-month high and far more than Wall Street expectations.\n\nIn a welcome economic boost for newly re-elected President George W Bush, the Labor Department figures come after a slow summer of weak jobs gains. Jobs were created in every sector of the US economy except manufacturing. While the separate unemployment rate went up to 5.5% from 5.4% in September, this was because more people were now actively seeking work.\n\nThe 337,000 new jobs added to US payrolls in October was twice the 169,000 figure that Wall Street economists had forecast. In addition, the Labor Department revised up the number of jobs created in the two previous months - to 139,000 in September instead of 96,000, and to 198,000 in August instead of 128,000. The better than expected jobs data had an immediate upward effect on stocks in New York, with the main Dow Jones index gaining 45.4 points to 10,360 by late morning trading. It looks like the job situation is improving and that this will support consumer spending going into the holidays, and offset some of the drag caused by high oil prices this year, said economist Gary Thayer of AG Edwards & Sons.\n\nOther analysts said the upbeat jobs data made it more likely that the US Federal Reserve would increase interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 2% when it meets next week. It should empower the Fed to clearly do something, said Robert MacIntosh, chief economist with Eaton Vance Management in Boston. Kathleen Utgoff, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor, said many of the 71,000 new construction jobs added in October were involved in rebuilding and clean-up work in Florida, and neighbouring Deep South states, following four hurricanes in August and September. The dollar rose temporarily on the job creation news before falling back to a new record low against the euro, as investors returned their attention to other economic factors, such as the USs record trade deficit. There is also speculation that President Bush will deliberately try to keep the dollar low in order to assist a growth in exports.\n	business
201	Safety alert as GM recalls cars\n\nThe worlds biggest carmaker General Motors (GM) is recalling nearly 200,000 vehicles in the US on safety grounds, according to federal regulators.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the largest recall involves 155,465 pickups, vans and sports utility vehicles (SUVs). This is because of possible malfunctions with the braking systems. The affected vehicles in the product recall are from the 2004 and 2005 model years, GM said. Those vehicles with potential faults are the Chevrolet Avalanche, Express, Kodiak, Silverade and Suburban; the GMC Savana, Sierra and Yukon.\n\nThe NHTSA said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack during normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was open. This could allow hydraulic fluid to leak, which could make it harder to brake or steer and could cause a crash, it warned. GM is also recalling 19,924 Cadillac XLR coupes, SRX SUVs and Pontiac Grand Prix sedans from the 2004 model year. This is because the accelerator pedal may not work properly in extremely cold temperatures, requiring more braking. In addition, the car giant is calling back 17,815 Buick Raniers, Chevrolet Trailblazers, GMC Envoys and Isuzu Ascenders from the 2005 model years because the windshield is not properly fitted and could fall out in a crash. However, GM stressed that it did not know of any injuries related to the problems. News of the recall follows an announcement last month that GM expects earnings this year be lower than in 2004. The worlds biggest car maker is grappling with losses in its European business, weak US sales and now a product recall. In January, GM said higher healthcare costs in North America, and lower profits at its financial services subsidiary would hurt its performance in 2005.\n	business

203	Owen determined to stay in Madrid\n\nEngland forward Michael Owen has told the BBC he is happy in Spain and has no plans to quit Real Madrid to return to the Premiership in the near future.\n\nBut the 25-year-old, who has spent much of his time coming off the bench in La Liga, did not rule out a return to the Premiership at some stage. Im pleased with the start Ive made here, he told BBC Radio Five Live. England is my country. Its definitely part of me but who knows whether, if or when Ill be playing there again. Owen, who moved to the Bernabeu from Liverpool last summer, has grabbed 11 goals for Real but has been unable to replace Raul or Ronaldo in the starting line-up. However, he said he was delighted with the way his time in Spain was going and dismissed criticism of his decision to join Real. When I first came there was a lot of scepticism back in England, any maybe some out here, he said. People were saying fourth-choice striker, what are you going there for? Youll be sat on the bench all the time.\n\nBut as much as our press like to build it up as if Ive permanently had my backside on the bench, Ive played as many games as anyone else in the team this year. For a fourth-choice striker at the start Im more than happy with the way Ive settled in. Recent speculation has linked Owen with a move back to England, with Newcastle expressing their interest, but the England striker said he is not ready to return home. He added: Ive got nothing against the Premiership, I mean thats where I first performed, thats where I made my name.\n\nI cant keep my eyes off the Premiership on television when Im at home. When asked if it would have to be Liverpool if he returned Owen said: Ive not really given it much thought. Ive got great memories of Liverpool. No matter what happens itll always be a club I have fond memories of and it will always have a place in my heart. Its very flattering to be linked to top clubs in England - Im glad that no-one is forgetting me! But I couldnt have wished for a better start in Madrid.\n\n- Listen to the full interview with Garry Richardson on BBC Radio Five Lives Sportsweek at 0900 GMT on Sunday.\n	sport

In the movie Timon and Pumbaa tell us where they came from and having trouble fitting in with others such as Timon having trouble digging tunnels with other Meercats! Timon and Pumbaa journey off into finding their dream place and find it and soon find it and also Simba who they raise but soon they must choose between their dream place or helping Simba face his evil Uncle Scar and proclaim his right as the Lion King of Pride Rock! Filled with wonderful new characters like Timons Ma(Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max (Jerry Stiller). I think my favorite character was Uncle Max because he was very funney and was voiced by a funney comedian Jerry Stiller the father of Ben Stiller. Disney was smart to cast Stiller in that role! Filled with wonderful characters, animation, and story and music Lion King 1 1/2 is in my opinion the best of any sequel and better than Simbas Pride even though I will admit I really did like that one too! Lion King 1 1/2 is a great Disney sequel the whole family can enjoy! Its got a good story and is very funney! 10 out of 10!	movie

The winner gets a deal with literary agency Curtis Brown. Im not going to be the Mr Nasty of books, said Cowell, 54, in reference to his brothers caustic remarks on TV shows Pop Idol and The X-Factor. The 2004 winner, Paul Cavanagh, went on to sign a deal with Harper Collins.\n\nThis year, the competition is specifically looking for a crime writer. Writers must submit up to 10,000 words from the opening chapters of their novels and a synopsis. Professional readers will choose a shortlist of five following the competition closing date on 14 January.\n\nThe final five will then have to read their work in front of judging panel. A public vote will also take place, which will account for 25% of the final decision. The winner will be announced at the London Book Fair on 14 March next year and could be screened on TV. Its very, very hard to find an agent and extremely difficult, without an agent, to get a publisher to look at your work, said Cowell. People do fall by the wayside and the more avenues we can provide for aspiring authors, the better, he added. Paul Cavanagh, a former university professor and health care consultant from Ontario in Canada, was one of 1,466 aspiring novelists to enter the first contest. He lifted the inaugural Lit Idol prize after reading aloud an excerpt of his work Northwest Passage. Three film studios are said to be interested in buying film rights for the book, even though it is not finished yet.\n	entertainment

210	Bellamy fined after row\n\nNewcastle have fined their Welsh striker Craig Bellamy two weeks wages - about £80,000 - following his row with manager Graeme Souness.\n\nBut Bellamy, 25, has not been put on the transfer list, although he did not train with the first team on Tuesday. Magpies chairman Freddy Shepherd told the Newcastle Evening Chronicle: It is not about money. It is about a player thinking he is bigger than this club. No individual is, be it the chairman, the manager or a player. Souness dropped Bellamy for Sundays game against Arsenal, claiming the Welshman had feigned injury after being asked to play out of position. When I heard what the manager was saying I was in shock, Bellamy said. I thought not only has he gone behind my back, hes lying, he said in response to Souness remarks. And the Wales international refused to apologise. I wont apologise because I have done nothing wrong, he told the Evening Chronicle. Theres no doubt about it, I am out of here. The difficult relationship between Souness and Bellamy boiled over at the weekend, and has led to a war of words in the media.\n\nBellamys claim that Souness had lied about the background to the bust-up was strongly denied by Shepherd, who accused the striker of cheating the club. I wish to put the record straight regarding the Bellamy situation, said Shepherd. Craig walked off the training ground saying his hamstring was tight (on Friday), but what he failed to reveal was that he had told other members of the squad before training that he intended to feign injury. When Graeme discovered this he immediately ordered Bellamy to attend a meeting in my office. At that meeting Bellamy admitted to Graeme and I that he had told the players that he was going to fake an injury in training and walk off. He also agreed at that meeting to apologise to his team-mates for his behaviour. He didnt do this which resulted in the action taken by the manager at the weekend, which I fully support. In my book this is cheating on the club, the supporters, the manager and his own team-mates. He is paid extremely well and I consider his behaviour to be totally unacceptable and totally unprofessional.\n\nBellamys latest outburst would appear to make his chances of a first-team recall remote. But even before Newcastle said the player would not be sold, Bellamy insisted he had no intention of handing in a transfer request. I dont want the fans to think for one minute that I wouldnt play for this club, he said. Id play anywhere for this club, even in goal. Its a very difficult situation for me at the moment but Id never ask to leave this club. This club means so much to me. I couldnt do it because I know I couldnt come back here and play against Newcastle. It would hurt too much.\n	sport
211	(Spoilers warning) I cannot say enough good things about this movie. It is a great horror comedy/spoof that does everything right for a change. The humor is great and ranges from funny to so-funny-youll-cry funny. In one scene, Ed goes edit-crazy and deletes a big scene. When his boss is looking at Eds edit, he yells out: Where in the fu%# is my beaver-rape scene?!?! Hysterical. There are also many other great, humorous & memorable quotes and moments throughout: Ed yells out Dont you fu#$ing look at me!!! while punching some poor schmuck repeatedly in the face. Very funny stuff. The plot of the movie itself is so ridiculous that its priceless: Ed is a mild-mannered everyday guy that gets moved over to the horror-film editing department, and after a while goes nuts, sees monsters, and attacks people while quoting the horror movies that he has edited. This movie has it all and is simply hilarious. The DVD only costs about $7, and is a great bargain as it is the unrated widescreen cut. I own a lot of DVDs, most of which cost a lot more money than this one, but not many are as great as this movie. My Evil Ed DVD is one of the highlights of my collection and i would beat someone with a telephone receiver if they tried to steal it. Evil Ed oozes style and quality -- something that Hollywood filmmakers need to majorly learn. Evil Ed is a rare gem, and i would like to thank everyone involved in making this wonderful movie -- you did everything right, and i love Evil Ed! 10 out of 10!!!	movie

213	What would you expect from a film titled Surviving Christmasand presented as festive fun, something like Ghandi or English patient? There are lots of things I love about this film, its funny, it is very well cast and it is superbly written. I came to the film as a Kaplan/Elfort fan but was dubious when I read the plot, it sounded ridiculous. But the film doesnt come across like that because Affleck (as Drew Latham) plays his part perfectly, one minute a child-like adult, the next a mature man who realises he has gained everything in life apart from what he really wants. In fact we see Latham grow up in this film, when he encounters the problems of those he envies and realises that their lives are not so good, he sees that his own lot is not so bad.This film has fewer weak or dud scenes than many other comedies I have seen. Comedy is so much harder than any other type of drama, it either works or it doesnt and very few comedy writers get it correct every time.I particularly loved the drama scene, where the family take to reading parts written by Latham . The pleasure is in the reaction of Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) and the comments of Brian Valco (Josh Zuckerman). It is the dilemma of the greedy Tom Valco who has to bite his tongue, wear silly hats or sing to the Christmas tree in order to earn the prize money that keeps the film moving along well.The addition of daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate) into the story brings a delightful romantic angle, and why not in a Christmas film? Of course its corny and contrived; hes rich and handsome, shes beautiful and single, and so inevitably her and Afflect end up falling over together in the snow and finding themselves face to face. Great! One thing I would have liked was more use of festive music to boost the atmosphere but I cant really complain. I got what I wanted.	movie

215	Blair pressing US on climate\n\nTony Blair is pressing the US to cut greenhouse gases despite its unwillingness to sign the Kyoto Protocol, Downing Street has indicated.\n\nOfficials have confirmed climate change was discussed when influential senator John McCain recently visited Mr Blair. Climate change was an issue the prime minister wanted to progress during the UKs presidency of the G8 and EU in 2005, said a spokesman. But he played down reports Mr Blair was considering a new US-friendly treaty.\n\nAccording to the Times, the UK leader wants to end US isolation with a Kyoto-lite agreement on the scale and nature of the threat from climate change. He is said to have discussed the idea with Mr McCain during his time at Number 10. The prime minister is said to believe the United States refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol on emissions is undermining other countries resolve to cut carbon dioxide production. So far the US has refused to sign up to the Kyoto treaty - which aims to cut emissions - branding it politically motivated and not based on science. President Bushs advisers have repeatedly denied global warming is taking place.\n\nEurope, which disputes the claim, has also signalled it wants to press ahead with talks about longer term climate change action in a way which involves both the United States and developing countries. Mr Blairs reported treaty would also establish an international programme to develop technology needed for renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions, says the Times. But there is still apparently little prospect of America agreeing to cut emissions, which could further provoke environmental campaigners already angry at the lack of progress. Mr Blair was left blushing on Wednesday when it emerged his manifesto target of a 20% cut to the 1990 greenhouse gas level by 2010 was set to be missed.\n	politics

221	Ferguson urges Henry punishment\n\nSir Alex Ferguson has called on the Football Association to punish Arsenals Thierry Henry for an incident involving Gabriel Heinze.\n\nFerguson believes Henry deliberately caught Heinze on the head with his knee during Uniteds controversial win. The United boss said it was worse than Ruud van Nistelrooys foul on Ashley Cole for which he got a three-game ban. We shall present it to the FA and see what they do. The tackle on Heinze was terrible, he said. Clubs are permitted to ask the FA to examine specific incidents but information is expected to be provided within 48 hours of the game. The clash occurred moments before half-time when a Freddie Ljungberg challenge left Heinze on the ground on the left touchline. Henry, following the ball, attempted to hurdle the Argentine but his knee collided with the back of Heinzes head.\n\nThe striker protested his innocence - and referee Mike Riley deemed the collision accidental. Ferguson was also upset by Arsenals overall discipline during the heated encounter between the two arch-rivals and praised his own sides behaviour. Edu produced a terrible tackle on Scholes that was a potential leg-breaker, he said. There were 24 fouls in the game by Arsenal, seven on Heinze, five on Ronaldo, six by Vieira - and it was only his sixth foul that got him booked. Phil Neville got booked for his first challenge. I am proud of my players for the way they handled that pressure. We have always been good at being gracious in defeat. What happened on Sunday overshadowed our achievement, but then they do it all the time, dont they?\n	sport
222	I was hoping that this film was going to be at least watchable. The plot was weak to say the least. I was expecting a lot more considering the cast line up (I wonder if any of them will include this on their CVs?). At least I didnt pay to rent it. The best part of the film is definitely Dani Behr, but the rest of the film is complete and utter PANTS.	movie
223	Bo is Jane Parker, whose long-lost anthropologist father (Richard Harris, in the worst role of a very inconsistent career) is in Africa studying something or another. She tracks him down (how?) and he tells her of the natives stories of a giant monster whose nightly howling can be heard throughout the jungle. Turns out to be the Ape Man himself (Miles OKeeffe, who has the films best dialogue), who rescues her from bad guys and falls in love with her, leaving them just enough time in this agonizing two hours to romp naked while a horny monkey looks on and cheers. Normally Im very open-minded to varying opinions about any film, but this is the sole exception. This is the worst film ever made. If you dont agree, you havent seen it. (Notes: Newsday called it unendurable, which is the best one-word summary I can think of. The Maltin Movie Guide comments that they almost had to think of a rating lower than BOMB.)	movie
224	I got about halfway through this movie and was very disappointed. It was just flat out boring and completely unrealistic. I can get past being unrealistic in a lot of movies, but not when its supposed to be a crime drama thing. The evidence collection and interview processes were just plain oddball. I started fast forwarding to see how it ended. And then got bored with that and just turned it off and returned it. The main character, played by Ellen Barkin, just wasnt believable at all. Peta Wilson acted very well in this film, but her character was way out there and there wasnt anyone for her acting talents to play off of that made it work.	movie
225	Air China in $1bn London listing\n\nChinas national airline is to make its overseas stock market debut with a dual listing in London and Hong Kong, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) has said.\n\nAir China plans to raise $1bn (£514m) from the flotation. Share trading will begin on 15 December, the LSE said. For Chinas aviation authorities, the listing is part of the modernisation of its airline sector to cope with soaring demand for air travel. No further details of the share price or number of shares were given.\n\nThe LSE has been working hard to woo Chinese companies to choose London, rather than New York for their listings. It opened an Asia-Pacific office in Hong Kong last month. We are delighted that Air China has chosen London for its listing outside China, said LSE chief executive Clara Furse. The London Stock Exchange offers ambitious Chinese companies access to the worlds most international equity market combined with high regulatory and corporate governance standards, she said. A spokesman for the LSE said: Weve been engaged with them (Air China) for about 18 months, two years now. As part of its pitch to bring listings to London, the LSE is thought to be highlighting the extra costs and red-tape imposed by new US laws passed since the Enron scandal, whilst stressing Londons strong regulatory environment.\n\nGermanys Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder began a three-day visit to Beijing on Monday by signing a deal worth 1bn euros ($1.3bn; £690m) for Airbus to sell 23 new planes to Air China, the Deutsche Welle radio station reported. Chinas booming economy has created huge demand for air travel among middle-class Chinese, turning the country into a sales battleground between rival plane makers Airbus and Boeing. Air Chinas long-awaited flotation is part of a strategy to modernise a dozen state-owned carriers, which have been reorganised into three groups under Air China, China Southern and China Eastern. Merrill Lynch are sole bookrunners for Air Chinas flotation, which will take the form of a share placing with institutional investors in London, though retail investors may be able to buy Air China shares in Hong Kong. Air Chinas primary listing will be in Hong Kong, with a secondary listing in London. The shares will be denominated in Hong Kong dollars. However, investors may be wary of Chinese stocks. The collapse last week of China Aviation Oil, the Singapore-listed arm of a Chinese jet fuel trader, has cast the spotlight on corporate governance shortcomings at Chinese firms.\n	business
226	This film promises much but delivers little. The basic problem has to do with the inclusion of Charlotte Gainsbourgs character in this film. Immigrants from Sicily did not need a redheaded Anglo in any way--the movie may have needed her, but new citizens certainly did not. In my opinion,the decision to include her destroys the continuity of the film. This is particularly troubling since it seems to demean not only the characters in the movie, but also the history of immigration itself. Immigrants themselves were heroic figures, fully capable of getting along without having to satisfied what I believer to be a veiled image of the white mans burden. I wonder if someone will make a movie of Irish immigrants which will include a Sicilian woman as a major character. The Left Elbow Index considers seven aspects of film--acting, production sets, dialogue, artistry, film continuity, plot, and character development--on a scale from high of 10 for excellent, 5 for average, and 1 for needs help. Both film continuity and plot rate a low of 1. The continuity as discussed above is further degraded by the surrealistic ending. Does not a film of such important historical significance deserve more than a conclusion which reminds one of Marc Chagall? The plot is simple enough, until it seems to become entangled with too much time in the old country, too little time on the ship, and too much emphasis on the ending. The acting and character development is average since all the characters are fixed throughout the film, and the inclusion of the Anglo-Saxon speaking perfect English almost turns the movie into a satire. Wheres Groucho when you need him? The production sets, the dialogue and the artistry are very good, each rating a 10. The sets in Sicily, on the ship, and on Ellis Island are as good as one can find. The dialogue is marvelous, and the ethic singing is superb. I agree with Scorsese that listening to the Sicilian dialect is a pleasure. Note that the immigrants speak of America, not the United States--the ideal vs. the political reality. The are many good artistic scenes, with dreams of America, gold coins raining, and giant veggies among the best. The average Left Elbow Index is 5.25, raised to a 7.0 when equated with the IMDb scale. One other notion seems to run through Ellis Island experience: the tribulations of pass immigrants was grueling, later, in 2006, one only had to pay a coyote or boat owner and sneak into the county under the darkness of night, no questions asked! The movie is worth seeing, but it appears that what one sees is problematical.	movie

Ive noted however, without a degree in something (unlike my father that quit at ninth grade) and a keen sense of greed and laziness, you cant get anywhere.I would like to know if anyone has this movie on DVD or VHS. its made for TV, and I just saw it an hour ago. Ic ant find it anywhere! Id love to show this to my friends, my pseudo friends, family and other relatives, see what they think and remind them that once upon a time, Americans WOULD work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished!!

Its easy to criticise someone whos being critical; people cry out, I bet you couldnt do any better! I bet I could ! Having made this film,watched it and then turned to congratulate each other with a pat on the back and a job well done; there must surely have been the spectre of lunacy in the room.	movie
231	GM pays $2bn to evade Fiat buyout\n\nGeneral Motors of the US is to pay Fiat 1.55bn euros ($2bn; £1.1bn) to get out of a deal which could have forced it to buy the Italian car maker outright.\n\nFiat had sold GM a stake in 2000, as part of a partnership agreement. But Fiats heavy losses have convinced GM - whose own European operations are in the red - to back away. The pay-off means the two firms will unwind joint ventures, but Fiat will keep supplying diesel engines and the money will allow it to reduce its debt. Fiats shares on the Milan stock exchange rose 4.5% by 0900 GMT to 6.2 euros, having shot up more than 7% in early trading. We now have absolute freedom to design our own future, said Fiat chief executive Sergio Marchionne.\n\nAnalysts said Fiat seemed to have done well out of the deal, although some predictions had expected a 2bn euro pay-off. Fiat is to get 1bn euros immediately, with another 550m to follow within 90 days. The firm is Italys largest private employer, and a failure to reach an agreement could have had severe consequences for thousands of workers and for the Italian economy. For its part, GM was keen to ward off any criticism that the deal had been a mistake.\n\nWe needed scale in Europe to get costs down, and we were able to do that in working with Fiat, said GM chief executive Rick Wagoner.\n\nThe Fiat-GM alliance came about in 2000 as an alternative to selling Fiat outright. German-US car firm DaimlerChrysler had been willing to buy the firm, but Fiat patriarch Gianni Agnelli did not want to give up control. Instead, GM swapped a 6% stake in itself for 20% of Fiat - and gave Fiat a put option to sell GM the rest of the car maker between January 2004 and July 2009. But despite the alliance Fiat failed to put itself back on track, continuing to lose money and market share. As a result, the sell-off looked better and better for the Italians - and much worse for GM, which is struggling with its own loss-making European marques Opel and Saab. The relationship soured further after Fiat sold half its finance arm and recapitalised in 2003, halving GMs stake to 10%.\n	business
232	Deadline nears for Fiat-GM deal\n\nFiat and General Motors (GM) have until midnight on 1 February to settle a disagreement over a potential takeover.\n\nThe deadline marks the point at which Fiat will gain the right to sell its car division to GM, part of an alliance agreed in 2000. GM, whose own European operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable Fiat unit. Reports of deadlocked talks sent Fiat shares down 1.2% on Tuesday, after Mondays 4% gain on hopes of a payoff. The US firm is thought to be offering about $2bn (£1.06bn) to extricate itself from the arrangement. It has argued the deal was voided by Fiats decision to sell off Fiats finance arm and halve GMs stake via a capital-raising effort.\n\nThe 2000 deal resulted from a race between GM and DaimlerChrysler to ally with Fiat. The German firm wanted to buy Fiat outright. But Gianni Agnelli, the godfather of the group, wanted to keep control, and preferred GMs offer to buy a 20% stake and give Fiat the right to sell in the future, known as a put option. Since then, however, Fiat cars have lost market share and the firm has piled up losses, while a plan to raise new money in 2003 cut GMs stake in half to 10%. For its part, GMs European units Opel and Saab have both had trouble, with Opel management threatening to cut 12,000 jobs. The last thing they need is additional production capacity in Europe, said Patrick Juchemich, auto analyst at Sal Oppenheim Bank.\n	business
233	TV station refuses adoption show\n\nA TV station in the US has refused to show a controversial new series where adopted children try and pick their birth father - and win a cash prize.\n\nThe WRAZ-TV Fox affiliate in North Carolina was the only one of 182 stations to refuse Mondays show. Whos Your Daddy promises $100,000 (£52,000) to the contestant if she correctly identifies her father. It was met with protests by the National Council for Adoption, which said it exploits sensitive emotions. It exploits the sensitive emotions of adoption, said Thomas Atwood, president of the National Council for Adoption. It trivialises them. Adoption is a very personal, meaningful experience and it should not be commercialised like this. On the pre-taped programme, the contestant is presented with eight men who may or may not be her natural father.\n\nIf she picks the correct man from the line-up, the contestant wins the jackpot prize of US$100,000 (£52,590). However, if she picks the wrong man, then the impostor takes the money. Fox producers defended the show, saying it was a positive experience. They have made six specials, though only one episode has so far been broadcast.\n\nThe special was thoroughly vetted by our standards and practices department to ensure that it was appropriate for broadcast, said a Fox spokesman. However, any network affiliate that feels the programming may be inappropriate for their individual market has the right to pre-empt the schedule. WRAZ-TV instead chose to air an independently-produced film, I Have Roots and Branches... Personal Reflections on Adoption, a documentary about families with adopted children. We just dont think adoption is a game show, said Tommy Schenck, WRAZ-TVs general manager, though he said his decision had not been influenced by public protests.\n	entertainment
234	India seeks to boost construction\n\nIndia has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100% foreign direct investment in its construction sector.\n\nKamal Nath, Commerce and Industry Minister, announced the decision in Delhi on Thursday following a cabinet meeting. Analysts say improving Indias infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too. The Indian governments decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector, according to some Indian firms.\n\nA spokesman for DLF Builders, Dr Vancheshwar, told the BBC this will mean better offerings for consumers as well as builders. He said the firm will benefit from world class strategic partnerships, design expertise and technology, while consumers will have better choice.\n\nThe government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100% will be allowed on the automatic route in the construction sector, on projects including housing, hotels, resorts, hospitals and educational establishments. The automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, which can be bureaucratic. The government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers, and benefit steel and brick-making industries.\n\nMr Nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired. Foreign investors can enter any construction development area, be it to build resorts, townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least 50,000 square meters (538,000 square feet) within a specific timeframe, said Mr Nath, without specifying the timeframe. Previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area, discouraging some from entering the Indian market. This measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively, without developing it. Anshuman Magazine, managing director, of CB Richard Ellis - an international real estate company - told the BBC this was a big positive step.\n\nHowever, Chittabrata Majumdar, general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), said allowing FDI in the country is compromising Indias own self reliance. He said, No country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone. Mr Majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country - in terms of employment and money generated - or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets.\n	business
265	No one can say I wasnt warned as I have read the reviews (both user & external), but like most of us attracted to horror movies... curiosity got this cat. (Come on, we all scream at the people in the movie not to go into the dark room, but you know thats horror aficionados are always dying to know whats in there even if we know itll be bad).The bottom line is that this movie left me angry. Not because it pretends to be real (who cares...gimmicks are allowed), or because the actors and dialogue are so lame (is this an unusual event in horror movies?) or even because the movie is so bad (and I am being polite here). What really got me mad is that the film is not only a rip off of BWP, but also a half-hearted lazy rip off at that.I dont believe in sacred cows and if they thought they could outdo BWP then kudos to them, but they didnt even try. The movie was made with little effort or care and that is the most unforgivable sin in horror (or any) movie!	movie
235	T in the Park sells out in days\n\nTickets for Scotlands biggest music festival have sold out in record time, five months before the event is held.\n\nThe 12th annual T in the Park festival, which takes place at Balado near Kinross in July, sold out just four days after the line-up was announced. Green Day, the Foo Fighters and Keane are among the acts that had already been lined up to appear at the event. However, the organisers have revealed Scots favourites Travis as well as soulman James Brown will also appear.\n\nLast year tickets sold out 10 weeks before the festival but organisers confirmed that all 130,000 for the two-day event had been sold. Geoff Ellis, CEO of festival organisers Big Day Out Ltd, said this years event promises to be the best yet. After last years sell-out, we did think this years event would sell slightly earlier, however this is way beyond our expectations, Mr Ellis said.\n\nWe are extremely proud that fans are so excited about T in the Park that they have made absolutely sure that their place at Balado is booked for 2005, and we will deliver one of the greatest events yet for them in July. More than 120 acts will play on eight stages over the weekend of 9 and 10 July. Brit Award winners Keane and The Streets are among the main attractions, while The Killers and dance act The Prodigy are also on the bill. Both Green Day and The Foo Fighters last played at the festival in 2002, the same year Oasis and Basement Jaxx were among the headline acts.\n	entertainment

It also plans to develop a worldwide entertainment concept with the brand, although details are not yet known. The groundbreaking Commodore 64 computer elicits fond memories for those who owned one back in the 1980s.\n\nIn the chronology of home computing, Commodore was one of the pioneers.\n\nThe Commodore 64, launched in 1982, was one of the first affordable home PCs. It was followed a few years later by the Amiga. The Commodore 64 sold more than any other single computer system, even to this day. The brand languished somewhat in the 1990s. Commodore International filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and was sold to Dutch firm Tulip Computers. In the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to Atari, which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games, formerly known as Infogrames.\n\nTulip Computers sold several products under the Commodore name, including portable USB storage devices and digital music players. It had planned to relaunch the brand, following an upsurge of nostalgia for 1980s-era games. Commodore 64 enthusiasts have written emulators for Windows PC, Apple Mac and even PDAs so that the original Commodore games can be still run. The sale of Commodore is expected to be complete in three weeks in a deal worth over £17m.\n	tech

247	Banker loses sexism claim\n\nA former executive at the London offices of Merrill Lynch has lost her £7.5m ($14.6m) sex discrimination case against the US investment bank.\n\nAn employment tribunal dismissed Stephanie Villalbas allegations of sexual discrimination and unequal pay. But the 42-year-old won her claim of unfair dismissal, resulting from her sacking in August 2003. Her partial victory is likely to cap her compensation to about £55,000, a tiny fraction of what she asked for. The extent of damages will be assessed in the New Year. The action - the biggest claim heard by an employment tribunal in the UK - had been viewed as something of a test case.\n\nThe tribunal decided that Ms Villalba had been unfairly dismissed because, having been removed from a senior post, she was entitled to wait to see if a suitable alternative position could be found in the organisation. Ms Villalba, the former head of Merrills private client business in Europe, has made no decision on whether to appeal.\n\nA spokesman for her lawyers described the decision as very disappointing, but pointed to some criticism of Merrills procedures within the lengthy judgement. The tribunal upheld Ms Villalbas claim of victimisation on certain specific issues, including bullying e-mails in connection with a contract, but said it found no evidence of laddish culture at the bank. We said from the start that this case was about performance not gender, Merrill said in a statement. Ms Villalba was removed by the very same person who had promoted her into the position and who then replaced her with another woman. Merrill Lynch is dedicated to creating a true meritocracy where every employee has the opportunity to advance based on their skills and hard work.\n\nBased in Londons financial district, Ms Villalba worked for Merrills global private client business in Europe, investing funds for some of Merrills most important customers. But in 2003 her employers told her she had no future after 17 years with the company, and she was made redundant. Merrill Lynch denied Ms Villalbas claims and said she was removed from her post because of the extensive losses the firm was suffering on the continent. The firm had told the tribunal that Ms Villalbas division had been losing about $1m a week. Merrill said Ms Villalba lacked the leadership skills to turn around the unit.\n	business
248	The Secret of Kells is a film Ive been waiting for for years after seeing some early footage at the Cartoon Saloon in Kilkenny. Im here to tell you now its been worth the wait. The cartoons are heavily stylised but not annoyingly so as Id feared. The whole film is a thing of beauty and great imagination, I particularly love the animated illuminated book where the little figures come to life on the page. The characterisation is superb, I love Brendan Gleesons voice as the stern Abbot and I especially liked the voice of the sprite Aisling. The forest is a triumph, such a beautiful place. The story is well realised, a mix of fact and fantasy. and really draws the viewer in to cheer on Brendan in his quest for the perfect materials for the Book. Im a lover of calligraphy and illumination anyway so the subject is close to my heart, but all the people I know whove seen this and are not fans of the craft agree that its a lovely little film. I will definitely buy the DVD when its released, and would like to say, well done Cartoon Saloon and all the people involved in this mammoth project. May there be many more. :) Coming back in here to say that I bought several copies of the DVD as soon as I could and gave them out at Christmas, everyone loves it! And I wish them all the luck in the world at the Oscars, such a joy to see this nominated.	movie

250	This film may seem dated today, but remember that it was made in 1974 -- before Saturday Night Live, before Howard Stern, back when George Carlin was just getting beyond the Hippie Dippie Weatherman and into heavy satiric humor. This film is the granddaddy of them all. Enjoy it for its historical significance, as well as for its strong entertainment value.	movie
251	Intense, funny, witty, and more than anything, social comedy on the ways of adult dating and its results-be it good or bad. Mohr and Nicholson are engaged couple two months away from a wedding date, when a bizarre event at their engagement party forces Nicholson to re-think the relationship and start to date other people so she wont feel so pristine when it comes to sexual experience. This leads to a disaster of events following Mohr, Nicholson, and their cohorts. Very intelligent and needed in this time of clumsy, condescending comedy, while containing your usual variety of comedic, sexual, and frustrated characters(especially Charles as a sexually frustrated sex fiend...very annoying) who even they seem to get the right feel to this heart felt commentary.The film goes the way films should go these days, showing that guys are sensitive at heart and have morals. Most of the male characters are the moralistic, straight forward eyes, while the woman are the fresh faced street prowlers who will stop at nothing to get pleasure. Guys will be appreciative of the message made for guys with self respect, however it is easy to assume that most males who DO see this film will use its message of male sensitivity cover up any flaw or trait that a female might find offending. Still, the writing formula uses this as a tool to pave the way for its male leads, particularly those of Mohr, Richter, and finding the director in a cameo as a sales man!The females are by far the most promiscuous as they speak of nothing but pleasure and what it would be like to... with someone else. They have amicable traits though, even though they are covered by the image of sex driven kittens. Very funny stuff.On another level, the film follows some of its ensemble into different relationship work. Richter meets up with a stressed divorcée(a VERY remarkable and noteworthy performance by the always reliable Helen Slater) named Penelope who is divorced with a son who hates her for splitting with his father. As the two go deeper into a relationship, human interest is revealed and both the comedy and tragedy of divorce and starting anew are studied. By the end of the film, Mohr and Nicholson have become way to deep over the heads to see whats coming next, and it is up to what they have learned about each other and themselves to decide what will come next. It becomes appropriate and dramatic at just the right time.Wallodorskis direction is emulated very well when the characters learn to face each other after all that has happened...with the right ending.All in all, this film should have been released nationwide, and I should hope that it is up for some Academy Awards...maybe Helen Slater can finally get the recognition she deserves. Anywho, this film is a no hits miss, give it all you got romantic sex farce, displayed very maturely and aesthetically.Great film!	movie

254	Berlin honours S Korean director\n\nSouth Korean film director Im Kwon-Taek has received an honorary Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival.\n\nIm, who has made more than 100 films in a 40-year career, was hailed for his remarkable visual beauty, technical innovation, and intellectual depth. Twenty of his films are screening in a special retrospective during the festival, which runs until 20 February. The veteran film-maker, 68, won the best director prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 2002 for Chihwaseon. Although his films vary in style, they all bear his unmistakable stamp: they are forceful and charged cinematographically, as well as reticent, stylised and musical, organisers said in a statement. Meanwhile, a film version of Bizets opera Carmen - translated into the South African language Xhosa - has received a warm reception at the festival. U-Carmen eKhayelitsha (Carmen in Khayelitsha), which is one of 21 films up for Berlins top prize, the Golden Bear, is British director Mark Dornford-Mays first feature film. Its the first time any opera has been translated into a black South African language. Xhosa works brilliantly, its such a musical language, said music director Charles Hazlewood.\n	entertainment
255	Indie film nominations announced\n\nMike Leighs award-winning abortion drama Vera Drake has scooped seven nominations at this years British Independent Film Awards.\n\nBut the Venice winner faces stiff competition from Shane Meadows critically acclaimed Dead Mans Shoes, which received eight nominations. Also in the running for a clutch of awards are My Summer of Love and the stalker drama Enduring Love. The winners will be announced at a ceremony in London on 30 November. The winners of the awards will be chosen by a jury chaired by Cold Mountain director Anthony Minghella and including actresses Cate Blanchett and Helena Bonham-Carter.\n\nThe awards, which recognise independent film-making in Britain, were established seven years ago. This years nominees reflect the growing strength and diversity of British independent filmmaking, said BIFA founder and director Elliot Grove. Commenting on the diversity of the nominated films, he added: Our selection committee had a harder time than ever narrowing down the field.\n\nJoining Vera Drake and Dead Mans Shoes in the running for best film are My Summer of Love, climbing documentary Touching the Void and zombie comedy Shaun of the Dead. Geoffrey Rush wins a best actor nomination for his role as Peter Sellers in the recent biopic The Life & Death of Peter Sellers.\n\nThe Australian star faces competition from Daniel Craig (Enduring Love), Phil Davis (Vera Drake), Ian Hart (Blind Fight) and Dead Mans Shoes star Paddy Considine. Considine is also nominated for a best supporting actor award for My Summer of Love. A rare US nominee, Scarlett Johansson, is among this years best actress contenders for her role in Girl with a Pearl Earring.\n\nFellow nominees include Imelda Staunton (Vera Drake), Natalie Press (My Summer of Love), Anne Reid (The Mother) and Eva Birthistle (Ae Fond Kiss... ). Shane Meadows and Kevin McDonald, both former winners of the Douglas Hickox Award (for Best Directorial Debut) won best director nominations. Seasoned film-makers Roger Michell, Mike Leigh and Pavel Pavlikowsky challenge them to the award. Harry Potter author JK Rowling will receive a special award for her contribution to the industry.\n	entertainment
256	Fosters buys stake in winemaker\n\nAustralian brewer Fosters has bought a large stake in Australian winemaker Southcorp, sparking rumours of a possible takeover.\n\nFosters bought 18.8% of Southcorp, the global winemaker behind the Penfolds, Lindemans and Rosemount brands, for 4.17 Australian dollars per share. A bid at that price would value the company at A$3.1bn ($2.4bn; £1.25bn ). Fosters said it was currently in discussions which may lead to a major corporate announcement.\n\nIn a separate statement, Southcorp confirmed the brewer had asked for talks. Both firms asked the Sydney stock market to suspend trading in their shares until Monday. Southcorps shares were suspended at A$4.25.\n\nFosters bought the 18.8% stake from Reline Investments, the family investment firm for the Oatleys, who founded the Rosemount Estates label and sold it to Southcorp in 2001. Robert Oatley and his son Sandy Oatley have both resigned from Southcorps board following the share deal. Southcorp employs 2,700 people and is the largest single investor in rural Australia, according to its website. The prospect of Fosters launching a major acquisition startled investors, as the brewer said last summer that it was not looking to expand through a big buy in the near future. It has cash available, after getting A$846m from selling property business Lensworth, but it has been widely expected to return cash to shareholders.\n\nPeople will scratching their heads over this one. Fosters has done a back-flip, said Shawn Burns, a fund manger at Deutsche Asset Management. Southcorps shares have risen in recent months on speculation that it could become a takeover target. It spent two years in the red, returning to profit in 2004. Consolidation in the wine industry is being driven by Constellation, the worlds biggest winemaker. It seized the top spot when it bought Australian firm BRL Hardy for just over $1bn in 2003. Since then, it has paid $1bn for US wine maker Robert Mondavi, bought last month. Fosters main wine business is Beringer Blass Wine Estate. Its best known brand is Fosters lager, though it makes a clutch of beer brands, and spirits. Analysts were divided on Thursday about whether Fosters was more likely to go for a takeover or merely wanted to take a big enough chunk of Southcorp to prevent it falling to a rival. Currently, I think the strategic position is more sensible rather than an outright takeover, said one analyst quoted by the Agence France Presse news agency. However, Matt Williams, a fund manager at Perpetual Trustees said taking the stake is definitely a precursor to a takeover.\n	business
257	Gurkhas to help tsunami victims\n\nBritain has offered to send a company of 120 Gurkhas to assist with the tsunami relief effort in Indonesia, Downing Street said.\n\nThe deployment would involve troops from the 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, based in Brunei. Discussions have begun with Indonesia on the exact timing and location of the deployment, but the government said the offer was aimed at the Aceh province. Downing St said a similar offer might be made to the Sri Lankan government.\n\nHowever a spokesman pointed out that there were particular logistical difficulties in Indonesia which the Gurkhas might be able to help with. The spokesman said: Following this mornings daily coordination meeting on the post-tsunami relief effort, the government has formally offered the Indonesian government the assistance of a company of British Army Gurkhas from 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles around 120 personnel and two helicopters. This is in addition to the ships and aircraft we have already committed to the relief operation in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIndonesia was by far the country worst affected by the tsunami, with 94,000 of the 140,000 confirmed deaths so far. International Development Minister Gareth Thomas said the assistance offer would most likely focus on the northern province of Aceh. We have offered the Gurkhas to help in the process of scaling up the relief effort, particularly in Aceh which is undoubtedly the hardest hit area in the Indian Ocean at the moment, he said. Weve also had RAF aircraft flying in equipment which the UN desperately need in order to set up a truly effective relief operation on the ground in Aceh province as well. The offer comes as the Foreign Secretary Jack Straw arrives in Indonesia for a special summit meeting on the disaster.\n	politics
258	Councils prepare to set tax rises\n\nCouncil tax in Scotland is set to rise by an average of about 4% in the coming year, BBC Scotland has learned.\n\nAuthorities will decide final figures on Thursday when projected increases will be more than twice the rate of inflation, which is currently 1.6%. The finance minister has urged councils to limit increases but they have warned that they will struggle to maintain services unless funding is increased. They say much additional government money is for new initiatives. Scottish Finance Minister, Tom McCabe MSP, said: Last week in parliament I announced an additional £419m for core expenditure to local government in Scotland. Thats a 5.5% increase and sits against an inflation rate of 1.6%, so I think we have quite rightly said to councils this year that we would at the very least ask them to exercise restraint. Mr McCabe is also looking for local authorities to become more efficient and save money in coming years. He told BBC Radio Scotlands Sunday Live programme: Here in Scotland we have 32 councils who all have their own individual collection systems for council tax, they have their own payroll systems and their own human resource systems.\n\nWe think there has to be opportunities there for rationalisation and using the money saved to reinvest in frontline services. The councils umbrella organisation Cosla, which provided BBC Scotland with the indicative figures for next year, warned that councils would face a continuous struggle to maintain services. Mr McCabe has promised them about £8.1bn next year. However, most of the increase is targeted to new initiatives and councils will experience difficulties in maintaining core services, a Cosla spokesman said. Cosla says that it is willing to work with the executive on finding efficiency savings but that these will not be enough to maintain services. They say the funding plans for the next three years will see councils lose more of the share of public spending. The Conservatives accuse the Scottish Executive of using the council tax to raise funds because it is too afraid to raise income tax.\n\nThe Tory finance spokesman, Brian Monteith MSP, said: Its a form of disguise... yet again we see that council tax is being used as a way of passing on costs. Scared of actually using its three pence income tax that it could put up, what weve seen over the years is more and more burdens being put onto local authorities and the council tax payer having to pick up the bill. There are also warnings that unless funding to councils is increased in the next few years then services may have to be reduced. Linda Knox, Director of the Scottish Local Authority Management Centre at Strathclyde University, said: With this current settlement the increase is slowing. At the same time, the burdens on councils are greater than they were. The settlement figures dont include pay increases and the executive is also requiring a substantial figure - in the area of £325m - in efficiency savings across the settlement period. Education will be protected from any cuts but Linda Knox says this will mean other services will suffer. She said: In practice, that will mean a 4-5% cut for other services. On the face of it the settlement looks like an increase of about 9.7% but by the time you take into account other factors its probably only about 1% in real terms.\n	politics

Because this was one of the most wasted 1½ hours Ive experienced.First of all, this is an complete rip-off of the great movie Battle Royale. It is as stupid as watching any lame American TV-show like Cops or Candid Camera.The plot are totally predictable. One challenger pregnant and another is a nurse, anyone doing some logic thinking understands in the beginning what should happen between those.The concept is ripped as mentioned before and the movie lacks the violence necessary of making this movie enjoyable. I mean, the preggo shoots a guy in the back and no blood or not even any trace of the hit in the back.I could go on forever without finding anything good about it, so take your money and get a copy of Battle Royale instead of watching this piece of crap.1 out of 10, too bad i couldnt rate it lower.

260	Llewellyn plans Wales retirement\n\nWales record cap holder Gareth Llewellyn will retire from Test rugby at the end of the Six Nations.\n\nThe veteran lock, who is 36 at the end of February, told BBC Wales Scrum V that it is time for him to bring down the curtain on his 92-cap Wales career. Llewellyn is on a one-season deal with French club side Narbonne, but said he may consider retiring from all rugby. I dont know what Ill do next year, whether to carry on playing or make a change in my career, Llewellyn said. Narbonne are really keen for me to stay on for next year, so Ive got to decide whether to stay on there or maybe go somewhere else, but ultimitely coaching is where Id like to end up. Ive done all the coaching awards and everything you can do in that respect, so its just hopefully getting a chance somewhere. Fellow locks Robert Sidoli and Brent Cockbain, who both scored tries in Saturdays Six Nations win in Italy, are Wales coach Mike Ruddocks preferred starters in the second row.\n\nWith the resurgence of the Dragons Ian Gough and the adaptibility of lock-cum-flanker Jon Thomas on the bench, Llewellyn has not yet made a match-day squad this Six Nations campaign. But the former Neath and Ospreys player is still targetting one last outing in the red shirt. If I do get on the field then brilliant, although the boys are doing really well and Im very pleased for them, Llewellyn added. Weve had some really tough years in Wales and the players have been through a hell of a lot. Sometimes the easiest thing would have been to throw the towel in and walk away, but a few of us dug in there and its really nice to see some of the boys getting the rewards now. I was going to retire at the end of the last Six Nations, Id even told some of the boys in the squad about it. But Mike (Ruddock) asked me to carry on for another season, which Ive done, still part of the squad, still trying to help them out as much as I can. Llewellyn made his Wales debut in 1989 against New Zealand as a 20-year-old, having caught the selectors eyes in the All Blacks tour match against Neath. The 6ft 6in player has not looked back since, going on to break Neil Jenkins Wales cap record on 12 June 2004 in the 50-44 loss in Argentina.\n\nTheres been lots of highs - winning the Six Nations in 94, beating England in 93, Ive been on some great tours and seen some fantastic countries, Llewellyn said. But I think the best thing of all for me was the time I spent with the players, Ive met some great guys in rugby and made some great friends. Itll be a bit strange on international days having to find somewhere to watch Wales play, but at least I might have time to get my golf handicap down! Llewellyn captained Neath for seven seasons, while being an integral part of the Neath-Swansea Ospreys regional sides first season. But with the Ospreys building for the future, Llewellyn was eventually forced to look to France for employment - digging in his heels during contract negotiations to insist he must be allowed to play for Wales.\n	sport
261	Injury doubts beset Wales squad\n\nWales have a clutch of injury worries before Wednesdays international friendly against Hungary in Cardiff.\n\nWest Hams Gavin Williams (ankle) looks certain to be out, so uncapped Wrexham defender Stephen Roberts is drafted in. Defenders Danny Gabbidon and Gareth Roberts, plus Ryan Giggs have hamstring concerns, while there are also doubts over Robbie Savage (groin). However, Manchester United winger Giggs is expected to recover in time to earn his 50th cap at the Millennium Stadium. There were also doubts over Gabbidons fellow Cardiff defender Rhys Weston, but the full-back appears to have shrugged off the knock he picked up in the Bluebirds 1-0 loss to West Ham on Sunday. The news leaves Wales boss John Toshack short in defence for his first game in charge, with Aston Villas Mark Delaney injured and James Collins with the Under-21s. That could clear the way for new faces Danny Collins and Dave Partridge to make their Wales debuts.\n\nCoyne (Burnley), Jones (Wolves), Roberts (Wrexham), Collins (Sunderland), Edwards (Wolves), Gabbidon (Cardiff), Page (Cardiff), Partridge (Motherwell), Ricketts (Swansea), Roberts (Tranmere), Weston (Cardiff), Davies (Tottenham), Fletcher (West Ham), Giggs (Man Utd), Koumas (West Brom), Robinson (Sunderland), Savage (Blackburn), Williams (West Ham), Bellamy (Newcastle), Earnshaw (West Brom), Hartson (Celtic).\n	sport
262	Howard taunts Blair over splits\n\nTony Blairs feud with Gordon Brown is damaging the way the UK is governed, Tory leader Michael Howard has claimed in a heated prime ministers questions.\n\nMr Howard asked: How can they fight crime when they are fighting each other? That question was later unveiled as the headline for new Tory campaign posters. But Mr Blair dismissed the talk of splits and said peoples priorities at the next elections would be on the economic successes achieved by Labour. He can stick up whatever he likes on billboards about something in a book but what the public will concentrate on are the low mortgages, low inflation, low unemployment that we delivered and that he failed to, he said. The chancellor is currently on a high-profile tour of Africa to highlight new anti-poverty plans. But before doing so, he insisted he still trusted Mr Blair, despite claims to the contrary in a new book.\n\nBrowns Britain, by Robert Peston, says there is mutual animosity between the two men. It claims Mr Blair said in November 2003 he would stand down as prime minister before the next election. But he went back on his pledge after support from Cabinet allies and suspicion that Mr Brown was manoeuvring against him, it says.\n\nMr Pestons book claimed that Mr Brown told Mr Blair: There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe. Mr Blair directly denied that quote on Wednesday. He again insisted there could be no deals about the premiership but twice declined directly to say whether or not he had offered to quit.\n\nThe Tory leader countered that such agreements had been struck twice at dinners with the chancellor. He declared: He is the deals on meals prime minister. No wonder the chancellor is not a happy eater. He continued: How can there be discipline in schools when there is no discipline in government, how can they clean up our hospitals when they dont clean up their act? Mr Blair said he would not respond to tittle tattle in books and promised to hail Labours record on the economy, waiting lists and law and order from now until polling day. Later at their poster launch Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said his party would exploit opportunities to show how juvenile the prime minister and chancellor were.\n\nLabour staged a show of unity at its own poster launch on Tuesday, where Mr Brown was joined by Alan Milburn, who Mr Blair controversially put in charge of election planning in place of the chancellor. But Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy told BBC News: The government is clearly split at the top. This kind of cosmetic exercise does not persuade anybody. Later this week Mr Blair is expected to outline the direction of his partys next election manifesto. The prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Mondays meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made Mr Pestons book.\n	politics
263	First let me say I am not from the south but I am an American. I dont love Country music but I can stomach it. I would never wear a cowboy hat but I wear hats. I dont live in a trailer but I do eat tuna salad and own a home. What does that have to do with this comment? A lot if you are one of those people who say only country people love this movie. This movie is loosely based on the They loved and lost premise. James Bridges directs an American love story as real as it gets. In an era of Jerry Springer and Lets put it out there mentality, this film rings truer than ever. Bud is coming of age and embarks on a life of his own with a little help from his aunt and uncle so he moves to the big city with them. Bud finds himself drawn into the local honky tonk world for the only escape a blue collar man can afford. He quickly meets Sissy who is from a similar background and the two have a whirlwind romance filled with painful ups and downs. (*This plot takes so many turns that one has to just sit for a few minutes before they get hooked. Marriage is a focus here that is often missed. Early in the film they marry and we view the transition from being single to married. The film highlights some of the modern struggles a woman has when she marries an old fashioned man. It also brings into view the male ego with women and competition.)Bud is challenged and is excited when Mickys puts in an electronic bull. Sissy gets ideas of having fun on it too but is quickly reminded that she is married and need to start acting like it. The emotion between the two characters is raw and expressive and the plot continues from there especially when they (NOTE THIS IS GIVING SOME OF THE STORYLINE AWAY) split and Sissy falls for an ex con with a penchant for abuse and cruelty. She soon realizes that the grass is not always greener on the other side.How anyone can compare Bud to Vinnie Barbirino is shocking to me. John Travolta gave an exceptional performance that was worthy recognition. He was believable and real. The scene where he shaves his beard and you first see him at the bar..still gives me goosebumps. Mind you I am not a huge Travolta fan, but come on, I see why Sissy was kicking of her boots so early in the film. Deb Winger was so real that you found yourself sympathizing with her as she pens a note of emotions to Bud, after sneaking in to clean his house during their break up. The supporting cast was incredible. Wes played by Scott Glenn gave a first rate performance that made you hate him and curse him as he abused Sissy. Madolyn Smith-Osborne, as Buds Mistress/girlfriend was so authentic that large chested girls across the U.S. prayed to wake up flat chested to wear the clothes she donned in the film. My biggest kudoss go to Barry Corbin and Brooke Anderson as Buds aunt and uncle. They seemed like someones aunt and uncle somewhere in Texas and however small their role, they made the film so much bigger and lifelike. Two memorable scenes were the Dolly Parton contest and the unforgettable scene where Bud and his aunt stand outside after one of the characters death. The dialog between them is touching.If you can watch this for what it is, a true American love story. Then I recommend that you take it for what it is...a film before its time that gave us voyeurism into a world unlike our own but real enough for our enjoyment and entertainment. If this world sounds similar to yours then you will enjoy it so much more. Lastly, the music however dated, is sure to send you back in time if you are over 30 years of age.	movie
264	I loved it, having been a fan of the original series, I have always wondered what the back story would be - it didnt fail to delight me. I also love the fact that apart from Eric Stoltz I didnt recognise one person - this is refreshing, much like BSG. It has introduced me to a whole wealth of new talent - cant wait for the series to start airing. Well done to Ronald D. Moore and team - excellent job. The special effects, dialogue and acting were all spot on, and I felt emotionally tied up in the storyline. I know there are purists out there that will probably disagree with my assessment, but I felt that Caprica was far superior to most of the Sci-Fi stuff produced in the last decade.	movie
266	In order to stop her homosexual friend Albert (Perry King) from being deported back to Belgium, Stella (Meg Foster) decides to marry him. The only other problem with that is that Stella herself is a lesbian. The two have their separate lives when one night after Alberts birthday party, they fall into bed and then into love. Later in the film after falling in love, Stella suspects Albert of cheating and shows up at his job one night late after closing. What she finds will leave the viewer stunned. This is a great film, very original. Perry King and Meg Foster are so good in their roles that it is amazing that they were not better recognized for their work here. Very controversial upon its release in 1978, the R rated film is now PG in this much more liberal time.Recently released on DVD, the disc contains a Making Of segment on the special features and in it its stated that the film was based on an actual story so the viewers who say the film is not real are mistaken. Everyone is an individual and different people fall in love for different reasons-these are the issues explored in this wonderful film for everyone who has ever loved!	movie

Two tabloid reporters, one seasoned(Miguel Ferrer)and one not so accomplished(Julie Entwisle), begin to believe that a serial killer(Michael H. Moss) may actually be a vampire. Stranger than odd is this modern day blood sucker does not wing his way naturally, but by way of a black Cessna he seeks his victims. The gore actually gets gruesome as the film nears its stupid finale. Keep in mind that Mr. King had nothing to do with this film. I do admit it is a bit scary in the wee hours of the night.	movie
269	Ten-year tragedy of missing Manic\n\nRichey Edwards, guitarist and lyricist for The Manic Street Preachers, vanished 10 years ago, on 1 February 1995. His disappearance remains one of the most tragic mysteries in rock music.\n\nFor his devoted fans, Richey Edwards was an inspired and inspiring poet, a man who articulated their desperation and despair, who shouted the things most kept hidden. The Manic Street Preachers may only have become stadium-conquering rock giants since his disappearance - but Edwards was the figurehead for their first, dangerous and dazzling incarnation. Edwards did not feature in the original line-up of the band, though. Singer/guitarist James Dean Bradfield, bassist Nicky Wire and drummer Sean Moore were originally accompanied by a rhythm guitarist called Flicker. But Edwards replaced Flicker in time for the bands self-financed debut, Suicide Alley, after designing the records artwork.\n\nAfter becoming a full-time member, Edwards became a critical part of the band, writing lyrics and playing guitar - though in many concerts, he was not actually plugged in. But the fiercely intelligent Edwards - who name-checked writers such as Sylvia Plath, George Orwell and Philip Larkin - battled depression, alcohol problems, eating disorders, and self-harm. By the time the band released their third album, The Holy Bible, in October 1994, Edwards had been admitted to hospital with depression. But in his last interview a few months later, seemed to be making plans for the future.\n\nEdwards walks out of the Embassy Hotel in London in the early morning, ahead of the bands US tour to promote The Holy Bible. In the following days, police issue a missing person alert and his parents, Graham and Sherry, plead for their son to let them know he is safe and well.\n\nPolice discover Edwards car in a car park near the Severn Bridge near Bristol - a notorious suicide spot. The discovery leads many to believe he has killed himself. The rest of the band stop touring and recording.\n\nThe band play their first concerts since Edwards disappearance as a trio, performing support slots for The Stone Roses on their UK stadium tour.\n\nThe Manic Street Preachers release their first music since Edwards disappearance. A Design For Life reaches number two in the UK singles chart. The album Everything Must Go follows.\n\nThe Manics win best band and best album for Everything Must Go at the Brit Awards.\n\nA fan says she saw Edwards in the hippy resort of Goa, India. Interpol are alerted but do not track him down.\n\nGraham and Sherry Edwards fly to the Spanish island of Fuerteventura six weeks after reports a man fitting their sons description has been seen in a bar called Underground. The report comes to nothing.\n\nEdwards sister Rachel makes an emotional TV appeal five years after the disappearance. Id just like to say to him if he is able to listen that we do love him very much and wed like him to come back - me, mum and dad, she said.\n\nThe band play a concert in the Cuban capital, Havana - the first contemporary western rock band to play there.\n\nOn the seventh anniversary of his disappearance, police offer Edwards parents the opportunity to sign a death certificate. They refuse.

A skeleton found by the River Severn is not Edwards, tests reveal.\n\nThe Manics seventh studio album, Lifeblood, features a song dedicated to Edwards called Cardiff Afterlife.\n\nThe remaining Manic Street Preachers members continue to pay a quarter of the bands royalties into an account held in his name.\n	entertainment
270	Disappointed Scott in solid start\n\nAllan Scott is confident of winning a medal at next weeks European Indoor Championships after a solid debut on the international circuit.\n\nThe 22-year-old Scot finished fourth in the 60m hurdles at the Jose M Cagigal Memorial meeting in Madrid. It was definitely a learning curve and I certainly havent ruled out challenging for a medal next week, said the East Kilbride athlete. The race was won by Felipe Vivancos, who equalled the Spanish record.\n\nSwedens Robert Kronberg was second, with Haitis Dudley Dorival in third. Scott was slightly disappointed with his run in the final. He won his heat in 7.64secs but ran 0.04secs slower in his first IAAF Indoor Grand Prix circuit final. I should have done better than that, he said. I felt I could have won it. I got a poor start - but I still felt I should have ran faster. Vivancos slashed his personal best to equal the Spanish record with a time of 7.60secs while Kronberg and Dorival clocked 7.62secs and 7.63secs respectively.\n	sport

272	Seamen sail into biometric future\n\nThe luxury cruise liner Crystal Harmony, currently in the Gulf of Mexico, is the unlikely setting for tests of biometric technology.\n\nAs holidaymakers enjoy balmy breezes, their ships crew is testing prototype versions of the worlds first internationally issued biometric ID cards, the seafarers equivalent of a passport. Along with the owners picture, name and personal details, the new Seafarers Identity Document incorporates a barcode representing unique features of its holders fingerprints. The cards are due to be issued in February next year, in line with the revised UN Convention on Seafarers Identity Documents of June 2003. Tests currently under way in the Caribbean are designed to ensure that new cards and their machine readers, produced by different companies in different countries, are working to interoperable standards. Results of the current tests, which involve seafarers from a wide range of occupations and nationalities, will be published by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) by the end of November. Crystal Cruises, which operates the Crystal Harmony, is exploring the use of biometrics but has not yet committed to the technology.\n\nAuthenti-corp, the US technology consultancy, has been working with the ILO on its technical specifications for the cards.\n\nIf youre issued a seafarers ID in your country, you want to be sure that when the ship lands in a port in, say, my country you can validate yourself using whatever equipment we have installed, Authenti-corps CEO, Cynthia Musselman, told the BBCs Go Digital programme. She said French, Jordanian and Nigerian nationals would be the first seafarers to get the new ID cards since their countries have already ratified the convention. It aims to combat international terrorism whilst guaranteeing the welfare the one million seafarers estimated to be at sea. The convention highlights the importance of access to shore facilities and shore leave as vital elements to a sailors wellbeing and, therefore, it says, to safer shipping and cleaner oceans. By increasing security on the seas as well as border control and protection, the cards will hopefully reduce the number of piracy problems around the world, said Ms Musselman. It should be a safer environment for seafarers to work in, and will allow people protecting their borders to have confidence that the people getting off the ship are, in fact, seafarers.\n	tech

274	A few buddies and myself have the strange hobby of seeking out really horrendous and utterly obscure (for a good reason) horror flicks and then subsequently watching them under the influence of mind-broadening consumer goods like alcohol and/or soft drugs. Surely a lot of people do this, but they watch movies like the Godzilla remake, whereas we torment our eyes and brains with stuff like The Loch Ness Horror. And, eureka, this is a prototypic bad movie! We open traditionally, with bag pipes music during the opening credits. This is, of course, to emphasize extra to us dumb viewers that the story is supposed to take place in the Scottish highlights and not in director Larry Buchanans birthplace Texas. For that exact same reason, the cast members are seemingly also instructed to overact tremendously and talk with talk with atrocious accents. The American marine biologist Prof. George Sanderson arrives in Loch Ness with some brand new and highly sophisticated sonar equipment to track down the whereabouts of the legendary monster in the lake. Meanwhile, there are many other parties hanging around the lake, like a group of kids on a Science Camp (what a boring way to spend your vacation), retired army generals looking for a Luftwaffe plane that crashed in the lake during WWII and a bunch of thieves and failed scientists that are steeling the monsters egg. You would think that these numerous sub plots bring some diversity and excitement in the plot, but unfortunately thats not the case. Loch Ness Horror is an overall boring flick with only a couple of noteworthy elements. The monster itself, for example, is a delightfully cheesy creation with cute eyes and a smoky breath. His teeth also glow in the dark, which is quite useful when youre dumb enough to go out on a boat ride in the middle of the night. Near the end of the film, the remaining cast members were more interested in the lost Luftwaffe plane than in the monster, so it was about time to wrap it up. Loch Ness Horror is carefully recommended in case youre a fan of bad B-movies from the 80s, but be advised that it contains an overload of senseless dialogs and a bizarrely rushed ending that makes it look as if the film suddenly ran out of budget.	movie

276	Wipro beats forecasts once again\n\nWipro, Indias third-biggest software firm, has reported a 60% rise in profit, topping market expectations.\n\nNet income in the last quarter was 4.3bn rupees ($98m; £52m), against 2.7bn a year earlier. Profit had been forecast to be 4.1bn rupees. Wipro offers services such as call centres to foreign clients and has worked for more than half of the companies on the Fortune 500 list. Wipro said demand was strong, allowing it to increase the prices it charged.\n\nOn the face of it, the results dont look very exciting, said Apurva Shah, an analyst at ASK-Raymond James. But the guidance is positive and pricing going up is good news. Third-quarter sales rose 34% to 20.9bn rupees. One problem identified by Wipro was the high turnover of its staff. It said that 90% of employees at its business process outsourcing operations had had to be replaced. We have to get that under control, said vice-chairman Vivek Paul. Wipro is majority owned by Indias richest man Azim Premji.\n	business
277	I thought maybe... maybe this could be good. An early appearance by the Re-Animator (Jeffery Combs); many homages to old horror movies; the Troma label on the front this movie could be a gem! I thought wrong.Frightmare is a boring, overplayed, half assed homage to the fright films of yore. The story is an old one, young people breaking into a house, getting drunk, making love, and tampering with things that shouldnt be tampered with. The oft  recycled slasher film formula is used here, this time with a thought to be dead actor named Conrad Radzoff doing the killing. In fact, the performance by the Radzoffs actor Ferdy Mayne is the only redeeming quality of this film. He does the snooty Dracula style character very well. But as for the kids, its not so good, with Combs only having a minimal part.The film lacks entertainment value, and only features one cool character, and one or two scenes that can hold your attention. I do not recommend this film unless you are desperate for something to watch, and this is the only movie left at blockbuster.	movie

279	Google launches TV search service\n\nThe net search giant Google has launched a search service that lets people look for TV programmes.\n\nThe service, Google Video beta, searches closed caption information that comes with programmes. It only searches US channel content currently. Results list programmes with still images and text from the point where the search phrase was spoken. It should expand over time to include content from more channels, said a Google spokesperson. The first version of the service is part of Googles expanding efforts to be a ubiquitous search engine for people to find what they want on the web and beyond. We think TV is a big part of peoples lives, said Jonathan Rosenberg, Googles vice president of product management. Ultimately, we would like to have all TV programming indexed.\n\nGoogle Video has been indexing US-based programmes from PBS, the NBA, Fox News, and C-SPAN since December. But there were few clues from Google about when more global broadcasters would be included. Over time, we plan to increase the number of television channels and video content available via Google Video but dont have more product details to share with you today, a Google spokesperson told the BBC News website.\n\nThe results thrown up by the search will also include programme and episode information like channel, date and time. It also lets people find the next time and channel where a programme will aired locally using a US zip code search function. Rival search engine Yahoo has been developing a similar type of video search for webcasts and TV clips which it promotes from its homepage. It offers direct links to websites with movies or other clips relevant to the search query, but does not pinpoint when the search query occurred. A spokeswoman told the Financial Times on Monday that Yahoo was adding captioning for Bloomberg, BBC and BSkyB broadcasts. A smaller service, blinkx.tv, was launched last month. It searches for and links to TV news, film trailers, and other video and audio clips.\n	tech
280	EA to take on film and TV giants\n\nVideo game giant Electronic Arts (EA) says it wants to become the biggest entertainment firm in the world.\n\nThe US firm says it wants to compete with companies such as Disney and will only achieve this by making games appeal to mainstream audiences. EA publishes blockbuster titles such as Fifa and John Madden, as well as video game versions of movies such as Harry Potter and the James Bond films. Its revenues were $3bn (£1.65bn) in 2004, which EA hoped to double by 2009. EA is the biggest games publisher in the world and in 2004 had 27 titles which sold in excess of one million copies each. Nine of the 20 biggest-selling games in the UK last year were published by EA.\n\nGerhard Florin, EAs managing director for European publishing, said: Doubling our industry in five years is not rocket science. He said it would take many years before EA could challenge Disney - which in 2004 reported revenues of $30bn (£16bn) - but it remained a goal for the company. We will be able to bring more people into gaming because games will be more emotional. Mr Florin predicted that the next round of games console would give developers enough power to create real emotion.\n\nIts the subtleties, the eyes, the mouth - 5,000 polygons doesnt really sell the emotion.\n\nWith PS3 and Xbox 2, we can go on the main character with 30,000 to 50,000 polygons, he said. With that increased firepower, the Finding Nemo video game looks just like the movie, but it will be interactive. Mr Florin said that more than 50% of all EAs games were sold to adults and played by adults, but the perception remained that the video game industry was for children. Our goal is to bring games to the masses which bring out emotions. EA said the video game industry was now bigger than the music industry. Nobody queues for music anymore.\n\nYou cant ignore an industry when people queue to buy a game at midnight because they are so desperate to play it, he said, referring to demand for titles for such as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Halo 2.\n\nJan Bolz, EAs vice president of sales and marketing in Europe, said the firm was working to give video games a more central role in popular culture. He said the company was in advanced stages of discussions over a reality TV show in which viewers could control the actions of the characters as in its popular game The Sims. One idea could be that youre controlling a family, telling them when to go to the kitchen and when to go to the bedroom, and with this mechanism you have gamers all over the world playing the show, said Mr Bolz.\n\nHe also said EA was planning an international awards show similar to the Oscars and the Grammys which would combine video games, music and movies. Mr Bolz said video games firm had to work more closely with celebrities. People will want to play video games if their heroes like Robbie Williams or Christina Aguilera are in them. Mr Florin said the challenge was to keep people playing in their 30s, 40s and 50s. Theres an indication that a 30 year old comes home from work and still wants to play games. If thats true, thats a big challenge for TV broadcasters - because watching TV is the biggest pastime at present.\n	tech
281	Record year for Chilean copper\n\nChiles copper industry has registered record earnings of $14.2bn in 2004, the governmental Chilean Copper Commission (Cochilco) has reported.\n\nStrong demand from Chinas fast-growing economy and high prices have fuelled production, said Cochilco vice president Patricio Cartagena. He added that the boom has allowed the government to collect $950m in taxes. Mr Cartagena said the industry expects to see investment worth $10bn over the next three years.\n\nWith these investments, clearly we are going to continue being the principle actor in the mining of copper. Its a consolidation of the industry with new projects and expansions that will support greater production. Australias BHP Billiton - which operates La Escondida, the worlds largest open pit copper mine - is planning to invest $1.9bn between now and 2007, while state-owned Codelco will spend about $1bn on various projects. Chile, the biggest copper producer in the world, is now analyzing ways of to keep prices stable at their current high levels, without killing off demand or leading customers to look for substitutes for copper. The copper price reached a 16-year high in October 2004. Production in Chile is expected rise 3.5% in 2005 to 5.5 million tonnes, said Mr Cartagena. Cochilco expects for 2005 a slight reduction on copper prices and forecasts export earnings will fall 10.7%.\n	business
282	Student fee factor played down\n\nA rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in Scotland.\n\nHowever, Lifelong Learning Minister Jim Wallace said that this would not result in Scottish students missing out. Applications from England and Wales rose by 17% between January 2005 and the previous year, up 23,600 to 27,700. Fears had been expressed that a flood of fee refugees would try to avoid top-up fees of up to £3,000 a year being introduced in England. In June last year, Mr Wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for English students studying in Scotland by £2,000 in an attempt to prevent a cross-border flood, although no figure has yet been agreed. Legislation to introduce the top-up fees in England is not due to take effect until autumn 2006 and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all.\n\nThe figures were made public on Thursday by admissions service Ucas. Universities Scotland, which represents university principals, claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to Scottish students being squeezed out. Director, David Caldwell, said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at English universities, but this was not a major factor. He told BBC Radio Scotlands Good Morning Scotland programme: The reason people are opting for Scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality, they offer very attractive courses and Scotland is seen as a very attractive place to study.\n\nThey know that when they take up their studies in 2006 they will be hit by top-up fees if they are going to a university in England and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to Scotland are so inflated. However, it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from England studying here. Mr Wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context. He explained that when applications were translated into acceptances, the number was not huge - an additional figure of about 200.\n\nAlso, the picture was further blurred by the fact that applications from Wales, where there are no plans for top-up fees, have also risen, by 19%. Mr Wallace said: Accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which Scottish higher education is held, not just in Britain. We want to make sure that when students are making their choice, they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to Scotland. We do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for Scottish students to get places at Scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option. Very often the quality of the university experience is enhanced by the fact there are students coming from a wide range of backgrounds so it would be wrong to go the other way and start excluding students.\n	politics
283	Bets off after Big Brother leak\n\nA bookmaker has stopped taking bets on Celebrity Big Brother after claiming sensitive information about the Channel 4 show had been leaked.\n\nWilliam Hill made the move after four people tried to place bets on Fridays surprise double eviction. This is highly unlikely to have been an inspired guess, William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams said. However, a Big Brother spokeswoman was satisfied that sensitive information about the show remained confidential.\n\nThe bookmaker said its suspicions had been aroused by betting for the last two contestant evictions, when people were still trying to place large sums despite odds as short as 1/14. But William Hills overwhelming evidence came on Friday when four unknown callers asked to place bets on the shows surprise double eviction.\n\nShortly afterwards model Caprice and actor Jeremy Edwards left the show. Mr Adams believed someone had gained access to figures which revealed how viewers were voting, and was using them to predict which celebrity would be evicted next. We think somebody somewhere has got them and has been trying very hard to take us to the cleaners, he said. The bets were not taken. Mr Adams did not believe anyone from Channel 4 or Big Brother producer Endemol had tried to place the queried bets. But he added: They need to look at how many people are privy to the sensitive information.\n\nBig Brothers spokeswoman said: Only a handful of senior production executives are privy to any sensitive information regarding eviction voting and there are strict procedures in place to keep this information strictly confidential. We do not feel the need to investigate this further as we are satisfied that these measures are effective. The shows independent adjudicator - the Electoral Reform Services - was also satisfied, she added. The current series of Celebrity Big Brother ends on Sunday, with Happy Mondays star Bez, actress Brigitte Nielsen and Blazin Squad rapper Kenzie competing for a £50,000 charity prize.\n\nBookmaker Ladbrokes said it would continue to accept bets on the final, with Kenzie its favourite at 2/9. We felt no need whatsoever to close the book, spokesman Warren Lush said. Weve seen absolutely no suspicious betting patterns. Mr Lush added that people sometimes vote on short odds because they think its like buying money. You do have to risk quite a lot of money for a very small gain but if they think theres no chance of an upset they will still do it, he said.\n	entertainment
284	The Seven-Ups is a good and engrossing film. Its packed with credible performances by Scheider, LaBianco and an effective scary performance by Richard Lynch - although most of the characters are card-board cut-out tough guys. Character development does not evolve at all on the screen. The only thing we know is the good guys are the good guys and the bad guys are bad. Deviating from the crime story norm, The Seven-Ups manage to throw Scheider and crew into the middle of a building plot in a unique writing twist. Onsite locations of New York City and an excellent choreographed car chase highlight the film. The only downside of the film is the slightly confusing plot line in the beginning. They give the viewer little evidence that the men being kidnapped are mob related (until later in the film). Had someone blindly started watching the film may be slightly confused on the story. Otherwise, The Seven-Ups is a gritty, testosterone-filled enjoyable time.	movie

288	This wouldve been a *great* silent film. The acting really is good, at least in a Look Ma, Im Doing Really Big Acting! sort of way.Everything is HUGE. Every line is PROFOUND! Every scene is SHATTERED BY HUMAN TRAGEDY!Mostly, I felt like gagging. Yet, like any train wreck, I couldnt tear my eyes away. This dialogue mightve worked on the stage, although I doubt it. On the screen, it was cluttered, haphazard, hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work.If you enjoy your melodrama in huge, heaping doses, you *might* enjoy the movie. Be prepared to wait, however. For all that melodrama, this thing sure plods along at its own pace.This script mustve sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves. It simply doesnt work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera.IMDB does us a great disservice, at times, when it uses its goofy computer-controlled weighted score. Curse of the Starving Class deserves less than a 1.Character-driven fiction is great, but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution, it isnt character development! Your characters must have a motivation. Being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is *not* character development. Thats a plot contrivance.Stay away from this movie. Or at the very least, watch it muted. Perhaps youll get some amusement from all the arm-waving the characters do.Oh, and word to the wise -- to prove that this is truly an artsy film, you see James Woods in all his dangly male look-at-me, Im-the-figurative-and-literal-representation-of-the-naked-vulnerability-of- man glory.Dont say you werent warned.	movie
289	All the reviewers are making one big mistake. This movie was not suppose to be taken seriously.It was made for kids and teens of the late 80ies or early 90ies and as such it was truly a film of its time. If you hated that period, or love the first movie so much that you cant even take a joke about it, then this is garbage, but only because it wasnt meant for you. The low budget here and failure of the Beastmaster 1 at the box office (grossed under four mil. with a nine mil. budget) were obviously the reasons to drop the seriousness of the original and to put it in the present day. You can complain about the story, dialog or logic, but again this was made to run, not to win races. If the movie had tried to take itself seriously it would be a total failure, but it doesnt do that for a second (in our world, Dar sees a movie theater thats advertising The Beastmaster 2, enough said). To paraphrase Clint Eastwood from Dirty Harry movies: This movie knows its limitations. Its more of a comedy/parody then usual adventure. Soundtrack (for the time) was also great. Actors arent taking themselves that seriously either so even the usually irritating spoiled rich brat role (played here very well by young Kari Wuhrer) turns out good. So, if you are nostalgic for the 80ies/90ies (cheese) culture, or you liked the first part, and dont mind going out on a cheese limb, youll have tremendous fun with this attempt to revive Dar in the 90ies (literarly). This is not really the sequel to the first, and dont watch it if thats what you want. Its more of a what if fantasy sequel.As for the why different dimension and not just different time question: When in history did we have those tall winged humanoid creatures that suck the flash of bones (from the end of part 1)? By the way, the movie ends in the Zoo because of an attempt at a cheap (moneywise) big finale. Its suppose to be the best place for Dar to show all his moves (him being the manipulator of animals).	movie

But Johnson, who has not competed indoors for five years, leapt to a life-time best of 6.50m in her last jump, after four fouls. Both Johnson and Sotherton passed the European Championships qualifying mark. Although Sothertons main aim in Madrid next month will be the pentathlon where she will take on Olympic heptathlon champion Carolina Kluft. Irelands\n\ndelivered a shock in the mens 200m as he stormed to his first major title in 21.01 seconds. British favourite Chris Lambert had to settle for second place while defending champion Irelands Paul Brizzel took third. There was some consolation for Lambert as he set a personal best of 20.94 in the first round - good enough to qualify for Europe.\n\nTwo-time AAAs champion Allyn Condon and Ian Mackie had no such luck as they were disqualified in the heats. There was plenty of hot action in the mens 60m hurdles where Scotlands\n\nwas vying for top spot with Olympian Andy Turner. Scott, 22, smashed his personal best on the way to the final, where he broke it again to win the AAAs title in 7.58 seconds. Turner finished second in 7.82 after previously setting a personal best on the 7.83 in the semi-finals, while Damien Greaves did not finish the final. The trio of athletes have reached the European qualifying mark this season though one of them is set to miss out on a call-up to the British squad.\n\ncomfortably defended her 3,000m title, clocking eight minutes, 49.87 seconds to easily surpass the European qualifying mark. The European cross country bronze medallist is ranked number one in Europe this season and will go to Madrid with high hopes. Helen Clitheroe was agonisingly close to the 9:05.00 qualifying mark as she claimed the runners-up spot in a personal best of 9:05.73. In the mens 800m heats,\n\nqualified fastest in the 800m heats to lay down a challenge to in-form\n\n. The Welsh runner attacked the last 200m to come through ahead of James Thie in one minute, 49.87 seconds. McIlroy, who is third in the European rankings, eased across the finish in 1:50.87 to set up a showdown in Sundays final in Sheffield. Both Watkins and McIlroy have already achieved the European qualifying mark. Scotlands Susan Deacon stole\n\ns thunder in the final of the womens 200m. Fraser became the fastest British woman over the distance this season when she qualified for the final in 23.68 seconds - though that time is outside the European standard. But Deacon claimed her first AAAs title over the distance, edging Fraser into second in 23.67. In the womens shot put veteran\n\nclaimed her fourth AAAs title with a throw of 15.27m. But that mark was not good enough for the 39-year-old to book her place at next months European Indoor Championships in Madrid. Sotherton finished fifth after producing two throws of 13.77m. In the absence of injured British number one Carl Myerscough,\n\nclaimed the mens shot put title with a throw of 17.64m, which was below the qualifying mark.\n\nSales Robert Mitchell climbed to a seasons best of 2.20m - just 3cm short of the European standard - to claim the British indoor high jump title.\n\ncould only clear 2.16m to finish in fourth but the 27-year-olds disappointment will be tempered as he had already achieved the qualifying mark at a meeting in Slovenia on Tuesday. There was bad luck for British number one\n\nin the pole vault as he failed to clear the bar after deciding to come in at 5.45m. The AAAs indoor title went instead to Ashley Swain, who climbed to a seasons best of 5.25m And Irelands Taniesha Scanlon set a new national record of 13.28m in the womens triple jump.\n	sport

292	This film looks great, and thats about where my praise ends. Love Is a Many Splendored Thing came out in the very schizophrenic year of 1955, when candy-coloured nonsense like this co-existed with trail-blazing artistic fair like Kiss Me Deadly. As a trend toward smaller, socially conscious films like On the Waterfront and Marty established itself in the mid-50s, other directors felt the need to stick with the unchallenging, pandering melodrama that classifies so many other films from that decade, and Love is one of the latter.This is the kind of 50s movie where the Technicolor is used to its garish utmost and the lighting is invariably high-key; even scenes taking place in a dark room or at night are brighter than the average sunny day. I never want to hear the theme song again, as its played frequently enough over the course of the film to last anyone a lifetime, and I certainly dont want to hear it sung by the shrill, ear-piercing choir that belts it out over the end titles. Jennifer Jones and William Holden are passable, but really anybody could have played these parts. Jones role is horribly written--her character is incredibly inconsistent, and it seems as if whenever her character is required to make a decision about something, the screenwriters flipped a coin to decide what that decision would be.People will undoubtedly tell me Im taking this film too seriously, that Im unromantic, etc. But I loved All That Heaven Allows, released the same year and just as cornball in its own way, except that Douglas Sirk is able to turn melodrama into an art form, whereas Henry King (director of Love) is not.Im usually able to enjoy bad melodrama, but in this case I was just bored.Grade: D+	movie

To even mention it along with Platoon or Full Metal Jacket is absurd. The battle sequences are pathetic, the dialog and acting atrocious.This so called group of storm troopers are regulars in the Wermacht. Not SS troops. There is so much wrong with this movie its sad. Bad editing, bad acting. Its got it all.The movie goes on and on and on as though the audience should be made to suffer as much as the soldiers did.I read in a review that the this film had a $20 million budget.For real? Where was it spent? In the fake train car sequences? In the pathetic special effects? Ugh.As a WWII history buff, and WWII movie fan, I found this movie to be a serious disappointment.For an excellent alternative war movie check out The Beast.

I guess some people just dont get it) I was interested in this movie. I read quite some positive stuff and the packaging and look of the movie seemed far from the total trash I expected after Rout city.Surprise: The movie isnt total trash but the problem seems to be exactly that. Timo Rose tries to walk in the footsteps of German Horror/Splatter Cinema like Olaf Ittenbach and the likes. That means Barricade is in parts extremely gory and detailed. The gore FX are not really believable but OK, the acting is OK but in some cases plain sucks. The hillbilly chick in the opening sequence is ridiculous and doesnt get better till shes shot.So what is the problem... the movie is gory, has a typical German underground vibe (including the classic booby shots in blood), OK FX and a modern feel to it like the packaging already promised?! 1. The script is total BS. You get a typical hillbilly/lost in the woods story with some guys+gal camping out and meeting a degenerated hillbilly family. Everything is just leading towards the torture/mutilation scenes and seems unbelievably random and pointless. This is the first thing that makes Barricade half-hearted.2. Random is also the perfect description for a lot of the camera work (I liked the repetitive cut to the tweezers in the extended booby torture scene... either they had no material or the editor works in a hardware store). Even worse the editing... sure, its modern and far better than a lot of other movies in the genre but its RANDOM. You got an overuse of that typical exposure effect everywhere and with no meaning ... its just there... all the time. Then theres some grainy/noisy film look which also is just thrown in here and there for the sake of it, I dont get the meaning.3. Like the fore-mentioned effects there is a lot of repetitive stuff in here. For example most of the kills are edited with multiple repetitions of stabbing and punching. Its OK once but here its annoying and fake, especially towards the end. Annoying also attributes the music which is permanently used without any change in the background. It doesnt take long until it makes the movie hardly bearable.4. From all this comes the biggest problem of this movie (and many others in my opinion). If you make a splatter movie with trashy feel its pretty idiotic to polish it with special FX and new school editing. It looks like they take it way too serious. Its no fun because the decent gore FX are plain wasted in this context. And where the classic gore FX are OK the computer FX in scenes like the stabbing in the mouth or the gunshots in the ending look rather silly(and 3D splatter mostly sucks to me even in movies with a budget and decent 3D artists).I often wondered if the time of serious splatter movies is over and Barricade is just another example it might be time to put it in the tomb. Its no fun, has no character and is too trashy for its look. The script is a cheap try on Wrong Turn and TCM leading absolutely nowhere. You can take that literally... the ending is just there and as random as many other things here (I love you in a splatter flick... come on!!). Barricade tries to incorporate a lot and fails...you can sure fast-forward through this movie for some extensive disembowelment, acid face melting,nipple pinching and classic Friday the 13th style stabbing of a couple while fingering in a tent (bloody boobies hooray!). But its really hard to get through this. Total failure especially because you can see it could have been something.	movie
297	Economy strong in election year\n\nUK businesses are set to prosper during the next few months - but this could trigger more interest rate rises, according to a report.\n\nOptimism is at its highest since 1997 and business will reap the benefits of a continuing rise in public spending, say researchers at BDO Stoy Hayward. The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold this week - but they could go up later in the year. Rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in May. The BDO optimism index - a leading indicator of GDP growth two quarters ahead edged up in January to 102.5, from 102.2 in October. The rise is due, in part, to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity.\n\nThe only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election, BDO said. Its BDOs output index - which predicts GDP movements a quarter in advance - remained at 100.8 for January, implying GDP growth at 2.9% in the second quarter of 2005. However, the output index is being held back by recent interest rate rises, sterlings strength against the dollar and high oil prices, the group noted. Its inflation index, which has risen continuously over the last 8 months, climbed to 110.0 in January from 108.0 in October last year. The UK is looking strong going into the general election, but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt ahead as the Bank of England reacts to growth and inflationary pressures, said Peter Hemington, partner at BDO Stoy Hayward. Growth will probably slow by the end of 2005 and it is likely that we will see higher interest rates or a sharp drop in demand for products and services.\n	business
298	i love this show! it is amazing...i can never miss an episode even if ive already seen it. the actors are perfect for the parts......i love Gilmore girls! ive gotten all my friends to watch it. even their parents watch it now. i watch it daily and i usually watch it more than once a day. i wish my mom was like Lorelei. my friends say that i talk and act like Lorelei. Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. it is a great teen show because they actually kind of learn from watching it. my vocabulary has widened from watching Gilmore Girls. Lauren graham and Alexis bled el are perfect for the parts of Lorelei and Rory. i think Luke and Lorelai should get married because Chris has left Lorelei and Rory way too many times. and has broken Loreleis heart too many times too.	movie
299	I was ten years old when I saw Subspecies, I instantly had the hots for Michael Watson and Laura Tate, they really do have some great on-screen chemistry in the earlier parts of the movie. I ordered a copy back in 1993 from Full Moon and I learned this: Ion and Rosa, the servants, have much bigger roles in the screenplay along with the King. What most people dont know is that there was an alternate sequence that was supposed to occur in the ending scene: Michelle and Stefan get cornered into a room and Michelle has the idea for Stefan to make her a vampire to help fight off Radu and her demonic controlled ex-friends. However, for some reason or another that scenario never made it on camera. Another scene in the script, that can be confirmed from the original trailer shows Stefan drinking blood from a wolf, or actually in the trailer you see him coming up with blood on his chin.This movie gets a 9 because its one from my childhood and I have fond memories attached to the characters; even though my favorite characters were Stefan and Michelle I think Anders Hoves Radu is pure feeling-evocative acting, so much feeling in his work there.	movie
300	I had high expectations following My Beautiful Laundrette, Bend it like Beckham and (less so) East is East. The histories of British Asians fitting into their adopted home has had many good runs on the big screen, as well as a number of excellent TV and radio series (Goodness gracious me, etc). This one falls flat. Inspite of a good start it rapidly went down hill.Ultimately this was a horribly typical BBC effort, complete with strong regional accents, whacky over-acting characters, a those were the days soundtrack, and lots of issues in an attempt to be worthy.I found myself cringing at many points during this film. The writing is predictable. Every possible cliche was dragged out and aired. In fact, I have trouble thinking of any cross-cultural/cross-generational devices that could have been used that werent. The characters were thin and cliched: the eccentric non-conformist minister; the well meaning but ultimately racist old woman; the over weight, overbearing aunt; the pushy Indian parents; the working class neighbour; the wise profound grandmother; the motorbike riding thug. The script was weak, with every chance to shock the audience with overt racist dialogue from the two dimentional racist white characters taken. And why it had to be set in the 70s (apart from needing an excuse for a 70s soundtrack) is a mystery. Possibly it make unbelievable characters slightly more believable to people born after 1979. I dont know.Even these things aside, good acting could have carried this into respectable obscurity. Instead, the usual BBC comedy suspects were wheeled out to ham it up. Bend it like Beckham had far better comic acting (and serious acting, in fact) than this, with a virtually unknown cast.In summary, a lazy cliched script, over acted, in a dull predictable story. Give it a miss.	movie
301	Souness delight at Euro progress\n\nBoss Graeme Souness felt Newcastle were never really in danger of going out of the Uefa Cup against Heerenveen.\n\nAn early own goal followed by an Alan Shearer strike earned them a 2-1 win and a place in the Uefa Cup last 16. Obviously with winning in the first leg it gave us a great advantage, he said after the 4-2 aggregate victory. We got our goals early and in the minds of some players the job was done but then they got a goal and perhaps made us a bit nervous. Shearers goal moved him within 12 of Jackie Milburns club scoring record of 200 for the Magpies. But Souness said he did not think beating the record would have any bearing on his decision to retire at the end of the season. I think if he got it this year he would want to stay next year anyway, he added.\n\nHe struck the ball very well - he always has done - and I think it was the power and pace that beat the goalkeeper. Souness also paid tribute to Laurent Robert, who was at the heart of much of Uniteds attacking play. In the first half he did really well and did everything you want from a wide player. More of the same in future please, he said.\n	sport
311	About the spoiler warning? Its not may contain, it -does- contain spoilers. Readers beware. Okay, first I need it to be known that Im not bashing the actors. Theyre just working with what theyre given. The problem was the script. It was horrendous. There was NOTHING believable about it at all. Sure, when you have a movie based on a murderous hitchhiker, theres going to be the bad mistake here and there that puts you in the terribly horrific, movie-worthy situation. But these girls just made stupid decision after stupid decision. The only girl smart enough to ever try and call the police was the girl added towards the end because hed already killed one and hit another with a car. Speaking of hitting her with a car...why the hell did she try and outrun a truck rather than run to the side like a normal person? Also, does the one who wrote the script honest to god believe cops are not going to investigate a door covered in blood? Frankly, it wasnt suspenseful either. The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were. Well, this rant has gone on way longer than I meant to for such a bad movie, so I wont bother to touch on the end besides the fact its unrealistic and lame.	movie
302	Jowell rejects Las Vegas jibe\n\nThe Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Tessa Jowell, has hit out at critics of the Gambling Bill.\n\nShe told the Guardian newspaper there would be no Las Vegas-style super-casinos, as rumoured in the press. Meanwhile Labour backbencher Stephen Pound labelled casino-related regeneration schemes a pile of pants. The MP for Ealing North claimed the legislation would encourage a mafia-like culture of vice and corruption, in an interview on BBC Radio 4. You look at some of the people who are involved...they arent in there to regenerate Blackpool. They are in it to fill their boots, Mr Pound told the Today programme. I just really think that we have made a terrible mistake here. And over all of it hangs the shadow of the men in the chalk-stripe suits with names that rhyme with spaghetti, he said.\n\nMs Jowell complained of the scale of misrepresentation in the media over the bill in her interview with the newspaper, her first since the bill was launched. The culture secretary said a four year consultation period had produced a consensus on the need to protect children and the vulnerable in a swiftly changing sector. Ms Jowell insisted: We have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country, for instance in social housing. And continued: We can be proud to have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the world. I intend to keep it that way. Ms Jowell will set out her position when the Bill is debated in the Commons on Monday. In prime ministers questions last week Tony Blair assured Parliament that 90% of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry.\n	politics
303	Iraq and Afghanistan in WTO talks\n\nThe World Trade Organisation (WTO) is to hold membership talks with both Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nBut Irans bid to join the trade body has been refused after the US blocked its application for the 21st time. The countries stand to reap huge benefits from membership of the group, whose purpose is to promote free trade. Joining, however, is a lengthy process. Chinas admission in 2001 took 15 years and talks with Russia and Saudi Arabia have been taking place for 10 years. Membership of the Geneva-based WTO helps guarantee a countrys goods receives equal treatment in the markets of other member states - a policy which has seen it become closely associated with globalisation.\n\nIraqs Trade Minister Mohammed Mustafa al-Jibouri welcomed the move, describing it as significant as Novembers decision by the Paris Club of creditor nations to write off 80% of the countrys debts. Assad Omar, Afghanistans envoy to the United Nations in Geneva, said accession would contribute to regional prosperity and global security. There are now 27 countries seeking membership of the WTO. Prospective members need to enter into negotiations with potential trading countries and change domestic laws to bring them in line with WTO regulations. Before the process gets under way, all 148 WTO members must give their backing to applicant countries. The US said it could not approve Irans application because it is currently reviewing relations. But several nations criticised the approach, and European Union ambassador to the WTO, Carlo Trojan, said Irans application must be treated independently of political issues.\n	business

Scrum-half Matt Dawson is also recalled, despite been left out of the initial squad after a row over clashing TV and training commitments. Bath lock Danny Grewcock will also start, pending a possible citing. England coach Andy Robinson has also awarded Gloucester flanker Andy Hazell his first Six Nations start. In another change to the side that lost to Australia in November, Leicester lock Ben Kay replaces Bath second row Steve Borthwick. Robinson was already without Jonny Wilkinson, Mike Tindall, Stuart Abbott, Richard Hill and Will Greenwood, while Mike Catt had been left out of Englands squad.\n\nJ Robinson (Sale Sharks, capt); M Cueto (Sale Sharks), M Tait (Newcastle), J Noon (Newcastle), J Lewsey (Wasps); C Hodgson (Sale Sharks), M Dawson (Wasps); G Rowntree (Leicester), S Thompson (Northampton), J White (Leicester), D Grewcock (Bath), B Kay (Leicester), L Moody (Leicester), A Hazell (Gloucester), J Worsley (Wasps).

307	What happened to Ava Gardner in the 1940s and Marilyn Monroe in the 50s also seemed to take place for modern-day actress Michelle Pfeiffer in the 80s: Her remarkable good looks got in the way of her being taken seriously as an accomplished, superbly talented actress. Anyone looking for validation of Pfeiffers dramatic abilities need look no further than her work in 1991s Frankie and Johnny or 92s Love Field (a personal favorite of mine); those looking to see what a splendid comedic actress she can be, when given the right part, should check out 1988s Married to the Mob. In this one, she plays Angela Demarco, the widow of a recently iced Mob hit-man, who moves from her garishly tacky Long Island home to start a new life for herself and her son, while being pursued by Mob boss Dean Stockwell and FBI man Matthew Modine. While this movie has lots going for it (a very amusing script; offbeat characters; sudden sharp turns to unexpected violence, as in director Jonathan Demmes previous effort Something Wild; and hilarious yet menacing performances by Stockwell and Mercedes Ruehl, as his jealous wife from hell), Michelle steals the show easily. Notice how perfectly she nails Angelas undereducated, Long Island Italian accent, and the many fine mannerisms that she brings to the role to really flesh out this spunky and surprisingly bright character. Once upon a time, long ago, Oscars were handed out to actresses for comedic roles such as this one. Had this film been made 60 years ago, Michelle mighta been a contenduh...	movie
308	I saw an advanced screening for this movie tonight. I absolutely loved it. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat all night. Cillian Murphy is extremely creepy as the villain. For those of you who have seen Batman Begins, his character was much scarier in this film. He played his character very well. The scariest bad guy, I have seen in awhile. Rachel McAdams was great. Everyone in the audience laughed, gasped and cheered at the same time, as if we were on cue. The suspense is held through out the movie. THe amazing part is that the end was not anti-climatic. I was not disappointed in the end. I felt satisfied. The trailer does not do the movie justice. The movie is much better than the trailer indicated. Do not wait for this movie to come out on video. Go see it. Although, I did not have to pay to see this movie, I would have gladly given 10.75 to see it. Enjoy!	movie

310	Mixed Christmas for US retailers\n\nUS retailers posted mixed results for December - with luxury retailers faring well while many others were forced to slash prices to lift sales.\n\nUpscale department store Nordstrom said same store sales were 9.3% higher than during the same period last year. Trendy youth labels also sold well, with sales jumping 28% at young womens clothing retailer Bebe Stores and 32.2% at American Eagle Outfitters. But Wal-Mart only saw its sales rise after it cut prices. The company saw a 3% rise in December sales, less than the 4.3% rise seen a year earlier.\n\nCustomers at the worlds biggest retailer are generally seen to be the most vulnerable to Americas economic woes.\n\nCommentators claim many have cut back on spending amid uncertainty over job security, while low and middle-income Americans have reined in spending in the face of higher gasoline prices. Analysts said Wal-Mart faced a stand-off with shoppers, stepping up its discounts as the festive season wore on, as consumers waited longer to get the best bargains. However, experts added that if prices had not been cut across the sector, Christmas sales - which account for nearly 23% of annual retail sales - would have been far worse. So far, we are faring better than expected, but the results are still split, Ken Perkins, an analyst at research firm RetailMetrics LLC, told Associated Press. Stores that have been struggling over the last couple of months appear to be continuing that trend. And for stores that have been doing well over the last several months, December was a good month. Overall, December sales are forecast to rise by 4.5% to $220bn - less than the 5.1% increase seen a year earlier.\n\nOne discount retailer to fare well in December was Costco Wholesale, which continued a recent run of upbeat results with a better-than-expected 8% jump in same store sales. However, the losers were many and varied. Home furnishings store Pier 1 Imports saw its same store sales sink by a larger-than-forecast 8.8% as it battled fierce competition. Leading electronics chain Best Buy, meanwhile, missed its sales target of a 3-5% rise in sales, turning in a 2.5% increase over the Christmas period. Accessory vendor Claires Stores also suffered as an expected last minute shopping rush never materialised, leaving its same store sales 5% higher, compared to a 6% rise last year. Jeweller Zale also felt little Christmas cheer with December sales down 0.7% on the same month last year. This was not a good period for retailers or shoppers. We saw a dearth of exciting, new items, Kurt Barnard, president of industry forecaster Retail Consulting Group, said. However, one beneficiary of the desertion of the High Street is expected to be online stores. According to a survey by Goldman Sachs & Co, Harris Interactive and Neilsen/Net Ratings sales surged 25% over the holiday season to $23.2bn.\n	business

313	Towards the end of the movie, I felt it was too technical. I felt like I was in a classroom watching how our Navy performs rescues at sea. I liked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers. I guess I should have figured that out before, but I never thought about it. Using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is odd and not realistic. The acting was pretty good, since theyre mostly seasoned professionals, but if youre going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen, it should be more like a fantasy, comical, etc. Everything was taken too seriously. At least the movie had Felix Ungar as pilot, with Buck Rogers, the night stalker, and Dracula also on board. The movie was filled with well known faces. I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama, but it does hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature. Thats why I said it should have been more comical. My pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about. They walk around with drinks, setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later, just as if theyre in a building or something, and acting as if turbulence just doesnt exist. Also, I know its a disaster movie, but suspense doesnt have to include a 30 second crash after hitting something. Anyway, the skilled actors and actresses keep this weak script from having been made into a movie that got canned after its first screening. I like Lee Grant, but it was fun to watch a psychotic person get decked...:)	movie

315	Charity single for quake relief\n\nSingers including Sir Cliff Richard and Boy George are recording a charity single to help raise funds for victims of the Asian tsunami.\n\nThey hope the song will raise more than £2m for the relief fund. The song, titled Grief Never Grows Old and described as a melancholy ballad, was written by radio DJ Mike Read. Former Boyzone singer Ronan Keating may also take part if a studio can be found close to where he is holidaying in Switzerland. Other music stars being approached include Robin and Barry Gibb of The Bee Gees, jazz sensation Jamie Cullum, Chris Rea and Olivia Newton-John.\n\nSir Cliff has recorded his vocal part in Barbados, while Boy George has recorded his in New York. Read wrote the song before the Boxing Day tragedy but had thought it was too gloomy to release. Now he plans to have it recorded by a collection of pop stars under the name One World Project. Its a natural home for it because people kept saying to me, its such a good song, but its such a sad song, Read said.\n\nHe said the song was a slow ballad and would work with around 10 singers, rather than a sing-along like the Band Aid 20 single raising money for famine relief in Africa. The backing track has already been recorded and organisers hope it can be finished within the next week to get it into record shops as soon as possible. Read went to the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), which is co-ordinating the British relief effort, with the idea the day after Boxing Day. I was totally shocked at the enormity and suddenness of the disaster and in tears on seeing the orphaned children wandering aimlessly in search of their parents, he said. Read said all the funds raised by the record would go to the DEC. Id only be pleased in terms of what it meant for sales if it got to number one, he added. The charity welcomed the news of the single and said money raised would help its agencies working in the affected region to rebuild survivors lives and livelihoods.\n	entertainment

317	Laporte tinkers with team\n\nFrance coach Bernard Laporte has made four changes to the starting line-up that beat England for Saturdays Six Nations clash with Wales.\n\nHe opted for Yannick Nyanga in the back row instead of Grand Slam winner Imanol Harinordoquy, who is back in the squad. Other changes see Julien Laharrague win his first cap at full-back, Aurelien Rougerie return after injury on the wing and Yannick Jauzion in at centre. But Laporte has resisted fan pressure to start Frederic Michalak at fly-half. The dependable Yann Delaigue keeps the number 10 jersey, despite clamours for the flair of Michalak. The 26-year-old Laharrague gets his chance despite playing on the wing for his club Brive.\n\nWe are launching him into the great international level, said team manager Jo Maso. He is young and this is a great opportunity for us and above all for him. There are 25 matches left before the World Cup so we must see as many players as possible. The competition is very high and open. Jauzion, Frances player of the year in 2004, would probably have played in the first two matches instead of the South African-born Liebeneberg had he been fit. The Stade Toulousain star wins his 23rd cap and is reunited with Damien Traille, with whom he forged an effective midfield in 2004. The return of Jauzion is going to be a plus for us, said Laporte. We are going to test him at an international level.\n\nJulien Laharrague (Brive), Aurelien Rougerie (Clermont), Yannick Jauzion (Stade Toulousain), Damien Traille (Biarritz), Christophe Dominici (Stade Francais), Yann Delaigue (Castres), Dimitri Yachvili (Biarritz), Julien Bonnaire (Bourgoin), Yannick Nyanga (Beziers), Serge Betsen (Biarritz), Jerome Thion (Biarritz), Fabien Pelous (Stade Toulousain, capt), Nicolas Mas (Perpignan), Sebastien Bruno (Sale), Sylvain Marconnet (Stade Francais)\n\nReplacements: William Servat (Stade Toulousain), Olivier Milloud (Bourgoin), Gregory Lamboley (Stade Toulousain), Imanol Harinordoquy (Biarritz), Pierre Mignoni (Clermont), Frederic Michalak (Stade Toulousain), Jean-Philippe Grandclaude (Perpignan)\n	sport

322	A wonderful family movie & a beautiful horse movie. 75+ %entertainment. Casey, Buddy, Kelly Marsh are very interesting and lovable characters. The horses are real beauties.Has the horse racing as a backdrop for showing how luck is sometimes nothing but some good commonsense. Shows how kids can do stupid things for stupid reasons. Shows how adults can do stupid things for selfish reasons. The very realistically portrayed characters transform the unrealistic theme of the film into something everyone can relate to.Andrew Rubin puts in a wonderful performance as Buddy,the sensible elder brother. Somewhat reminded me of Aidan Quinn(eyes, speech delivery, facial appearance). Casey makes you fall in love with the character because of the earnestness. Sarah Blue is also nicely portrayed by Alexis Smith. Lloyd Bourdelle, the father, is played by Walter Matthau and he IS the character.Though there is room for improvement in the movie, its a very enjoyable, feel-good movie.	movie
323	Well Im not the worlds biggest Sondheim fan, so although I have the cast album and Ive listened to it a few times Ive never actually seen this show performed and I havent seen the Tim Burton movie version either. I felt like I wanted to see something more faithful before I see the Burton one and give it a chance just as a movie. This version isnt a movie at all, its a filmed play with some of the original members of the cast, including most importantly Angela Lansburys performance as Nellie Lovett. This is one of those performances thats just like a conduit into the heart of the magic of Broadway and theater itself. She must have had so much fun with this role. Sweeney Todd himself isnt played by Len Cariou, who did it originally, but by George Hearn. Hearn does a fantastic job; his voice isnt quite as good as Carious, but he seems to play it a bit broader.The only problem I had really was with the Johanna character as played by Betsy Joslyn, and to some extent her lover Anthony as played by Cris Groenendaal. Joslyns voice cant sustain high notes, but I wasnt entirely sure if that was maybe supposed to be the point since Im not hugely familiar with this play. More importantly, Im not sure if the story of Sweeney Todd really holds up enough weight to sustain some of the music, but thankfully the whole thing doesnt seem to have been taken too seriously by its creators. As a lark, and a bit of comedy in the vein of Grand Guignol, its quite enjoyable. I dont feel like its as significant a piece of work as Company and Into the Woods or some of his other shows. Some of the music is quite spectacular, but at other points it seems to exist in a world outside of the show.I wont say a whole lot about it here because this is a film website and this is really not a film, but just a play that has been shot on film. There were maybe 3 or 4 scenes where they moved the camera around but that was it. People will want to see this, because it preserves Lansburys legendary performance which deserves its legendary status because its a hilarious and insightful performance. George Hearn can be proud of his version of Sweeney as well. This would be a good film to show children over the age of 5 or so to get them interested in musicals because the blood and cannibalism will really surprise them. Seeing a performance filmed so expertly and so faithfully makes me wish that more efforts like this had been made over the years with musical theater, because I prefer shows from the 20s through the 50s to these later era affairs. Sweeney Todd is an exceptional show from its era however, miles and miles above the AL Webber madness.	movie

325	Many of the classic films of the late 60s havent retained their ability to disturb and confront the audience. In Cold Blood hasnt lost an ounce of its power. Its exceptionally well made yet forces the viewer to think. Some have complained not only about the film, but about Truman Capotes source non-fiction novel, that the central message is unsubtle. That may be true, but this is definitely a case where the lack of ambiguity doesnt detract from the film at all. Its refreshing, especially considering todays simplistic and manipulative moral dramas, to see a film with a convinced political voice unafraid to force the audience to consider its viewpoint. To be honest, Im not sure if I agree with the films central message, but I admire its audacity nonetheless.Even if you disagree with the anti-capital punishment message, theres plenty to admire about the film. The acting from the two leads is terrific. Scott Wilson (still one of the most underrated actors ever) is chilling as the nihilistic leader, one who uses his charisma to hide his weaknesses. Robert Blake is also chilling as the more submissive of the two and the one with a conscience. His character obviously has a voice of reason, but is terrified to go against Wilson (theres a good amount of homoerotic subtext on his characters part). The cinematography is terrific, sleek yet gritty and really giving the impression the viewer is watching a documentary. Add another classic score from Quincey Jones, and you have a masterpiece.

326	Unless theres some huge ironic conspiracy going on, my jaw dropped when I read the positive reviews of this film; I cannot believe that this film was even released, its so bad.I admit it is not my kind of movie, but I tried to watch it objectively anyway, you know, so bad its funny, and was still offended at its sheer awfulness.The acting is atrocious, they cant have watched the rushes and Im guessing there was one take per scene, it really is that terrible. It is the worst film I have seen in many a year, in fact, I wouldnt even call it a film, its a tragedy. The gay black friend, whom no-one actually calls gay, its just implied because hes so crazy? Homophobic. This is not good, in fact, this is downright vomit inducing. The jokes die on their pathetic arses, the music is so bad it defies belief. The person who compiled the soundtrack essentially chose the most ear-mutilatingly bad songs they had ever heard and put them in this waste of film stock. Oh my good Christ I cant believe the 80s produced utter garbage like this, I grew up through them, and I cannot find one thing worth of note here, it must have been a dark time to be a cinema-goer.If you even contemplate watching this film go see a psychiatrist, he will then accordingly slap you, you sick, sick person.	movie
327	US industrial output growth eases\n\nUS industrial production continued to rise in November, albeit at a slower pace than the previous month.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve said output from factories, mines and utilities rose 0.3% - in line with forecasts - from a revised 0.6% increase in October. Analysts added that if the carmaking sector - which saw production fall 0.5% - had been excluded the data would have been more impressive. The latest increase means industrial output has grown 4.2% in the past year. Many analysts were upbeat about the prospects for the US economy, with the increase in production coming on the heels of news of a recovery in retail sales. This is very consistent with an economy growing at 3.5 to 4.0%. It is congruent with job growth and consumer optimism, Comerica chief economist David Littman said of the figures.\n\nThe US economy grew at a respectable annual rate of 3.7% in the three months between July and September, while jobs growth averaged 178,000 during the same period. While the employment figures are not spectacular, experts believe they are enough to whittle away at Americas 5.4% jobless rate. A breakdown of the latest production figures shows mining output drove the increase, surging 2.1%, while factory output rose 0.3%. But utility output dropped 1.4%. Meanwhile, the amount of factory capacity in use during the month rose to 77.6% - its highest level since May 2001. Many investors think that product market inflation wont be a problem until the utilisation rates are at 80% or higher, Cary Leahy, senior US economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, said. So there is still a lot of inflation-fighting slack in the manufacturing sector, Overall Id say manufacturing at least away from autos continues to improve and I would bet that it improves at a faster rate in coming months given how lean inventories are, Citigroup senior economist Steven Wieting added.\n	business

330	Henman & Murray claim LTA awards\n\nTim Henman was named player of the year for 2004 by the Lawn Tennis Association at Wimbledon on Monday.\n\nThe Briton was recognised for the best year of his career, which saw him reach the semis at the French and US Opens. Scotlands Andrew Murray was named young player of the year after winning the US Open juniors, as well as a Futures event in Italy. And world number one Peter Norfolk won disabled player of the year after claiming his third US Open crown.\n\nGreat Britains under 14 boys won the team of the year prize for their victory at the World Junior Tennis event in August. Henman will start his 2005 campaign at the Kooyong event on 12 January in a field that includes Roger Federer, Andy Roddick and Andre Agassi. And the Briton is optimistic of surpassing his best effort of a fourth-round place at the Australian Open, which begins the following week. Ive often felt that the conditions suit my game in Melbourne so Id love to be able to start next year by doing well at the Australian Open, Henman told his website. Thats why Ive changed my schedule slightly by committing to play in the Kooyong Classic. Ill be able to acclimatise while practising before the event and then will be guaranteed matches against the best players in the world. I think that will give me the best possible chance of doing well at the Australian Open.\n	sport
331	Love Rosario Dawson, think shes one of the finest actresses of the modern era.Descent seems to be more about self-empowerment than anything else. Its the consistent undertone in everything in the film. The dialog is flat, the characters seemingly intentionally bland and one sided. The only consistency is the representation of self-empowerment in the characters and Rosarios journey from self empowerment to loss of empowerment and back again.Pitching this as a rape classic isnt appropriate, and thats probably why so many people dont enjoy the film. The standard rape audience wouldnt particularly like this film, and maybe thats the point? The film asks more questions than it answers, and it does confront its target audience, whether they like it or not. Theres a compelling relationship between the characters and the target audience and while the film doesnt slap the audience across the face with self-righteous audacity it does engage the viewer for what may or may not be, all the wrong reasons.Descent is a good film which IMHO is severely under-rated.	movie
332	The entire movie, an artful adaptation of one of Joyces Dubliners stories, takes place on the night of January 6 (Epiphany), 1906. Most of the film takes place at an annual party given by three spinsters (two sisters and their niece), where a group of upper-class Dubliners gather for an evening of music, recitations and dinner. While there is very little plot per se, the interaction and conversation among the group reveals much about Dublin in the early 20th century when the stirrings for independence were just beginning. The cast, all talented Irish stage actors with the exception of Anjelica Huston, are universally wonderful, and one actually feels he is a guest at the gathering himself. The poignant final scene, between Ms. Huston and the amazing Donal McCann, reveals much about the marriage of the characters. There is poignancy mixed with humor and insight, and for those who like quiet, thoughtful movies, The Dead is highly recommended. My wife is from Dublin, we make a ritual of watching this wonderful movie every January 6th. After many viewings it never fails to move me, and each time I glean something that Ive missed before.	movie
333	I saw this movie only after hearing raves about it for years. Needless to say, the actual experience proved a bit anticlimactic. But still, Alec Guiness energetically leads a wonderful cast in a jolly, if formulaic, romp through industrial post-WWII England.This is the familiar tale of the woes of inventing the perfect everyday product. Remember the car that runs on water? Remember the promise of nuclear energy? In this case, its a fabric that doesnt wear out, wrinkle, or even get dirty! Of course, fabric manufacturers and their workers are horrified at the prospect of being put out of business, and so the plot gets a bit thick.Guiness makes the whole enterprise worthwhile, and watching him blow up a factory research lab over and over again is quite a blast! (Those Brits ... always the stiff upper lip when under fire.) The film might chug along exactly like Guinesss goofy invention, but its a good ride all the same.	movie
334	Software watching while you work\n\nSoftware that can not only monitor every keystroke and action performed at a PC but also be used as legally binding evidence of wrong-doing has been unveiled.\n\nWorries about cyber-crime and sabotage have prompted many employers to consider monitoring employees. The developers behind the system claim it is a break-through in the way data is monitored and stored. But privacy advocates are concerned by the invasive nature of such software.\n\nThe system is a joint venture between security firm 3ami and storage specialists BridgeHead Software. They have joined forces to create a system which can monitor computer activity, store it and retrieve disputed files within minutes. More and more firms are finding themselves in deep water as a result of data misuse. Sabotage and data theft are most commonly committed from within an organisation according to the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU) A survey conducted on its behalf by NOP found evidence that more than 80% of medium and large companies have been victims of some form of cyber-crime. BridgeHead Software has come up with techniques to prove, to a legal standard, that any stored file on a PC has not been tampered with. Ironically the impetus for developing the system came as a result of the Freedom of Information Act, which requires companies to store all data for a certain amount of time.\n\nThe storage system has been incorporated into an application developed by security firm 3ami which allows every action on a computer to be logged. Potentially it could help employers to follow the trail of stolen files and pinpoint whether they had been emailed to a third party, copied, printed, deleted or saved to CD, floppy disk, memory stick or flash card. Other activities the system can monitor include the downloading of pornography, the use of racist or bullying language or the copying of applications for personal use. Increasingly organisations that handle sensitive data, such as governments, are using biometric log-ins such as fingerprinting to provide conclusive proof of who was using a particular machine at any given time. Privacy advocates are concerned that monitoring at work is not only damaging to employees privacy but also to the relationship between employers and their staff. That is not the case, said Tim Ellsmore, managing director of 3ami. It is not about replacing dialogue but there are issues that you can talk through but you still need proof, he said. People need to recognise that you are using a PC as a representative of a company and that employers have a legal requirement to store data, he added.\n	tech
335	Milburn defends poster campaign\n\nLabours election chief Alan Milburn has defended his partys campaign posters amid Tory claims the ads were nothing short of sly anti-Semitism.\n\nMr Milburn said he appreciated peoples concerns, but insisted that what they were was anti-Tory and not in any way, shape or form anti-Semitic. He was responding to Tory spokesman Julian Lewis who said the ads were part of a wider trend of smearing the party. Labour has withdrawn two controversial posters and launched four new designs.\n\nA row was sparked after the party published posters appearing to depict Michael Howard, who is Jewish, as Fagin, and as a flying pig, amid claims they were anti-Semitic. The posters were labelled a big misjudgement by the Conservatives who said Labours first shot in the election has badly backfired.\n\nThe posters were among a series of ideas shown to Labour members, who were asked to vote on their favourite. Labour has taken them off its website, saying members preferred other posters. The partys four new designs, launched on Tuesday, steer clear of the Fagin or flying pig images, but make clear that Labour is sticking to its strategy of targeting the Tory leader personally, with reminders of his record in office.\n\nThe posters were among a series of ideas shown to Labour members, who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election. In the Commons, Tory spokesman Mr Lewis suggested the posters were part of a wider trend and reminded MPs that Labour chairman Ian McCartney last year described shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin as a 21st Century Fagin.\n\nGiven the outrage that that smear caused then, how could you have thought anything other than the fact that what you were doing in reviving it in your poster advertisements was nothing more and nothing less than a calculated campaign of sly anti-Semitism? Mr Milburn replied that they were not anti-Semitic. What they were was anti-Tory and I make no apologies at all for making clear to the British public exactly what the Conservative plans would mean, he said. I fully understand and indeed respect the views of those who have concerns about any poster designs that have appeared on the Labour Party website. The Fagin and pigs might fly posters were taken off Labours website on Monday after supporters voted for their favourite poster featuring Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin holding a blackboard reading 2+2=5. A Labour spokesman later said their removal from the partys website was not affected by the row.\n	politics
336	Chick Flick? Of course.... Been done before? Many times.... Predictable? Yes..... Worth watching? You bet! I was delighted with Sarandon and Portmans portrayals of otherwise stock characters in a familiar story line. I am a great fan of mother/daughter stories. What makes the difference between the good ones and the weak ones ARE the performances and the character development. Although this is not the BEST of its genre, I will buy it and watch it again. I felt the characters were believable and the acting was superior.	movie

Budget, production value, or experienced crew dont have to stop the self described director from realizing their dream these days.Respect for the craft of film-making, or even just respect for any film aesthetic are no longer prerequisites for actually executing a film.Director Bill Cowell must have thought he struck gold when Lions Gate decided to market his original film as a sequel to a film he had nothing to do with.I personally find Lions Gate far, far more in error than Cowell in regard to Dark Harvest 2 being made available to the public. Lions Gates deceptive marketing of this film should be investigated by the state attorney generals office and Lions Gates officers should be pickled in sulfuric acid and kerosene for their utter disregard for film, film-making, and good sense.As for the film itself, its not even worth commenting on.	movie

340	The movie eXistenZ is about a futuristic video game on a pod system that is almost like virtual reality. The only copy of the video game is damaged when an assassination attempt is made on the designer (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Unless it can be repaired, the many years and 38 million dollars spent on the development will all go to waste. The only way to repair the game however, is to actually go in the game with the only person she feels she can trust(Jude Law). This movie was pretty good, but doesnt really pick up until very late in the film. The best thing about this film were the twists toward the end. Definitely worth seeing. 7/10	movie
341	Crackerjack is a hit and miss film set in the Australian suburban lawn bowls club of Cityside. Mick Molloy plays a scammer who has been scoring free parking spaces at Cityside. When the club is put under pressure to install poker machines in its premises they need to raise $8000 to keep this from happening. The club needs new members to help and this is where Mick molloys character comes in and has to bowl to save the club. With many up and coming and aging Australian actors Crackerjack is a hidden gem. Be warned though most of the jokes are for those with a knowledge of lawn bowls but there are many amusing sight gags that provide comical relief. Sam Johnson and Judith Lucy co-star. Overall the movie should be recommended for people who play lawn bowls or have played but there is enough other material in there for an amusing play if you have a slight understanding. If you enjoy Australian humour I suggest you get youre bowling whites on and head on out to the theatre because this is the premiere lawn bowls comedy of the year(also the only one).	movie

343	I would of given this film a zero out of ten, but i will give it a two. Reason One is that Shah Rukh Khan appears in the film, which is not really a reason. Last Point is that Rani Appears in this film and does a smooch with Kamal. I Love Rani very much and have a respect that she is a great actress. Which is why i didnt enjoy her in this movie kissing Kamal, but its no big deal. Anyway enough of the bedroom scenes that made this film noticeable, lets actually talk about this film. Is it good or bad, I think its a completely rubbish movie that made me yawn. Me being a Fantastic critic, you can see my other 250+ reviews by clicking on my name, I have great taste. The movie is not entertaining is one thing and if this is suppose to be hard hitting cinema, why is there no morale in this movie. Its a biased movie thats not a true story and it stinks. Watching Kamal kissing these actresses makes me sick, Man cant kiss properly anyway.	movie
344	Blair backs pre-election budget\n\nTony Blair has backed Chancellor Gordon Browns pre-Budget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the UK economy.\n\nIn a speech in Edinburgh, the prime minister said Thursdays report reinforced stability and opportunity. And that would be central to Labours next election campaign, planning for which was already well advanced. Mr Brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4s Today programme: No politician should make the mistake that John Major and his colleagues made in 1992 of saying no matter what the circumstances are, they can make all sorts of guarantees on every individual thing.\n\nThat is not what politicians should do, it would not be responsible to do. Mr Brown insisted his spending plans were affordable and he could afford to be optimistic because Britain was now a stable, low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising. Mr Blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the cornerstone of Labours programme.\n\nIn a speech at Edinburghs Napier University, he said Labour would publish over the next few months a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term.\n\nIn every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future, much clearer than those in 1997 or 2001. All of it fits together around common themes of opportunity, security and stability for all, Mr Blair said. In his pre-Budget report, Mr Brown surprised some City experts by forecasting UK growth at between 3% and 3.5% for next year. Many believe the figure is more likely to be under 3% - and fear tax rises or spending cuts, saying tax receipts have been overestimated. Carl Emmerson, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC News: He thinks everything will come out in the wash and it will, in fact, be OK. Were not so sure. David Page, of Investec Securities, said: His forecast that he will meet the golden rule with a margin of £8bn is way too optimistic. Its going to take a significant turnaround in the economy to meet these targets.\n\nConservative Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: I cant find a single economic forecaster from the IMF to the Institute of Fiscal Studies who believes anything other than the chancellor has got a black hole in his finances. In order to deal with that he will have to raise taxes after the next general election. Mr Letwin accused the chancellor of using fancy statistics to hide public service failures. Vincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, called on Mr Brown to open up the governments books to the National Audit Office, to see if he had met his golden rule. It is very clear that there are some serious loose ends in government public spending, Mr Cable told MPs.\n	politics
345	**********SPOILER ALERT***************If you happen to like JURASSIC PARK 1, 2, or 3:If you happen to appreciate really bad movies for their sheer entertainment value if not for their quality (case in point-John Carpenters DARK STAR-highly recommended)If you happen to like movies about dinosaurs in general-THEN STAY AWAY FROM THIS CINEMATIC CRAPSTERPIECE!The shameless use of stock footage from CARNOSAUR 1 & 2 make up most of this miserable attempt at a dino/slasher flick- Take the scene, for instance, where the security guard meets his doom at the jaws of the Alpha T-Rex. For some reason, he drops about 50 pounds and appears 10 years younger. Why is that? Simply because this scene was lifted directly from CARNOSAUR, which was a crummy flick to begin with.The ending was a carbon copy of CARNOSAUR 2, for those unfortunate enough to have sat through that straight-to-video loser. Again, we see Mr. Rex do battle against a bulldozer-which alternates as a forklift truck-through the miracle of -ta-daa!- stock footage from the aforementioned CARNOSAUR 1 & 2. Of course, the ending is exactly the same-the beast falls to his death just as the complex goes up in flames.A real insult to anyones intelligence.But its still better than watching the ROSIE O DONNEL SHOW.Rating: 1/2* out of *****	movie
346	SEC to rethink post-Enron rules\n\nThe US stock market watchdogs chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new US corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms.\n\nIn a speech at the London School of Economics, William Donaldson promised several initiatives. European firms have protested that US laws introduced after the Enron scandal make Wall Street listings too costly. The US regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\nThe Act comes into force in mid-2005. It obliges all firms with US stock market listings to make declarations, which, critics say, will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts.\n\nFirms that break the new law could face huge fines, while senior executives risk jail terms of up to 20 years. Mr Donaldson said that although the Act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements. There are few, if any, who disagree with the intentions of the Act, which obliges chief executives to sign a statement taking responsibility for the accuracy of the accounts. But European firms with secondary listings in New York have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing. The Act also applies to firms with more than 300 US shareholders, a situation many firms without US listings could find themselves in.\n\nThe 300-shareholder threshold has drawn anger as it effectively blocks the most obvious remedy, a delisting. Mr Donaldson said the SEC would consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process for foreign firms unwilling to meet US requirements.\n\nWe should seek a solution that will preserve investor protections without turning the US market into one with no exit, he said. He revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the Acts least popular measure - Section 404 - for foreign firms. Seen as particularly costly to implement, Section 404 obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firms internal controls by signing a compliance statement in the annual accounts. The SEC has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms - including US ones - with market capitalisations below $700m (£374m).\n\nA delegation of European firms visited the SEC in December to press for change, the Financial Times reported.\n\nIt was led by Digby Jones, director general of the UKs Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and included representatives of BASF, Siemens and Cadbury Schweppes. Compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of US listings. Air China picked the London Stock Exchange for its secondary listing in its $1.07bn (£558m) stock market debut last month. There are also rumours that two Chinese state-run banks - China Construction Bank and Bank of China - have abandoned plans for multi-billion dollar listings in New York later this year. Instead, the cost of Sarbanes-Oxley has persuaded them to stick to a single listing in Hong Kong, according to press reports in China.\n	business

I liked Robin Harris and most of his comedy but the really funny routines were not meant to be something the whole family could go see. Liken it to taking the point of one of Jerry Seinfelds jokes and attempting to squeeze the joke for as long as you can in order to turn it into a movie.

351	S Korea spending boost to economy\n\nSouth Korea will boost state spending next year in an effort to create jobs and kick start its sputtering economy.\n\nIt has earmarked 100 trillion won ($96bn) for the first six months of 2005, 60% of its total annual budget. The governments main problems are slumping consumption and a contraction in the construction industry. It aims to create 400,000 jobs and will focus on infrastructure and home building, as well as providing public firms with money to hire new workers.\n\nThe government has set an economic growth rate target of 5% for next year and hinted that would be in danger unless it took action. Internal and external economic conditions are likely to remain unfavourable in 2005, the Finance and Economy Ministry said in a statement.\n\nIt blamed continuing uncertainties such as fluctuating oil prices and foreign exchange rates and stagnant domestic demand that has shown few signs of a quick rebound. In 2004, growth will be between 4.7% and 4.8%, the ministry said. Not everyone is convinced the plan will work. Our primary worry centres on the what we believe is the governments overly optimistic view that its front loading of the budget will be enough to turn the economy around, consultancy 4Cast said in a report.\n\nThe problem facing South Korea is that many consumers are reeling from the effects of a credit bubble that only recently burst. Millions of South Koreans are defaulting on their credit card bills, and the countrys biggest card lender has been hovering on the verge of bankruptcy for months. As part of its spending plans, the government said it will ask firms to roll over mortgage loans that come due in the first half of 2005 . It also pledged to look at ways of helping families on low incomes.\n\nThe government voiced concern about the effect of redundancies in the building trade. Given the economic spill over and employment effect in the construction sector, a sharp downturn in the construction industry could have other adverse effects, the ministry said.\n\nAs a result, South Korea will give private companies also will be given the chance to build schools, hospitals, houses and other public buildings. It also will look at real estate tax system. Other plans on the table include promoting new industries such as bio-technology and nano-technology, as well as offering increased support to small and medium sized businesses. The focus will be on job creation and economic recovery, given that unfavourable domestic and global conditions are likely to dog the Korean economy in 2005, the ministry said.\n	business
